But certain changes, not very material, and almost always incidental to a new boat, had to be made. After her first winter's experience in the ice, the Minto had to go into dock to be re-riveted, but the same thing occurred when the Stanley was built, after she had a season's experience in the ice. There was, however, a larger number of loose rivets in the Minto than in the Stanley, and I communicated direct to Gourley Bros., asking them whether, considering the number of rivets that had to be re-riveted, they should not bear their share of the expense.

of maintenance, and, although it says the cost of maintaining, it appears to be what we are discussing, maintenance and repairs. His vote in 1899-1900 was $180,000, and the hon. gentleman was apparently of the opinion that that was the normal amount for the last two years, and for this year as estimated, and yet, according to the table it was an extraordinary amount, and an explanation is given in a note. It says that this $180,000, which is $40,000 more than was required the year before, includes outfit and stores to the Minto in Scotland, which properly belongs to construction. There is the explanation, and if this statement of the hon. gentleman be correct, there has a tremendous leap been made in the expenditure. The amount asked for was $111,000 in 1891-92, $146,000 in 1892-93, and then it dropped down to $129,000 in 1894-95, and to $117,000 in 1897-98. Then, in 1898-99, it was $145,000. Then there is this item of $180,000 accompanied by the explanation which I have read. We have the Auditor General's Report, showing that last year it was increased to $180,000. I think the hon. gentleman says that he is going to take $180,000 this year, with one steamer less.

I take page and I find that $3,236 was paid to Stewart, Bruce & Co., of Charlottetown, for such articles as pumps, closets, pipes, and such matters of construction as that.

She would have gone earlier to her berth at Summerside but for the reason I have explained to the hon. gentleman from 'Gasp6, her boilers had to be repaired after the summer's work on the fishery service. The very day that the work was finished she proceeded to Pictou, coaled there and went straight to Summerside to make the experiment of keeping open the winter passage between that and Cape Tor-mentine. I had informed the board of trade of Summerside some time previously that there were no terminal facilities at Cape Tormentine, and that I thought it was inadvisable to make the experiment until these facilities were provided. They, however, pressed upon me very strongly that the attempt should be made and I submitted the matter to Captain Finiayson, of the Minto, who has had some twenty-two years experience, and to Captain Brown, of the Stanley, and they advised that it was possible that if the board ice formed for half a mile outside of Tormentine pier they might be able to land on the board ice, and they advised that the experiment might be made. On their report I sent the vessel there. The board ice did not form; they had to land near the pier. The pier was in such bad condition that the ballast had fallen out and prevented the bow of the vessel getting near it. There was no way therefore to land freight if they had carried it. and until my friend the Minister of Public Works (Hon. Mr. Tarte) is able to get that pier repaired it would be impossible for the Stanley to utilize it as a terminus. I am in hopes that this season the minister (Hon.- Mr. Tarte) will be able to repair the pier. The Stanley made the experiment of crossing and recrossing every day and successfully for a time, but the smallpox broke out in the district near to Cape Tormentine. Passengers would not travel through the region where the smallpox was supposed to be, and a very large number of people in Prince Edward Island were averse to the service being maintained through an infected district of that kind. The mails were not, and ought not be sent, that way, and after the Stanley had made a number of trips without carrying freight, passengers, or mails, there was no use continuing her on the route any longer and she was ordered to go to Pictou. At Pictou there was an enormous congestion of freight which one steamer could not move, and the idea of sending the Stanley to Pictou was to give daily communication with Georgetown, one boat running each way. We were very successful in moving the freight, and until the other day when
we got into this terrible storm there never was a time when the winter communication was maintained so admirably as it has been this winter. I am in hopes that next winter the terminal facilities at Tormentine will be -so improved that possibly the Stanley will be able to utilize it, and continue the experiment between Summerside and Tormentine.

The most expert captain on Prince Edward Island in connection with ice breaking, reporting to the minister on November 1, made this statement-the hon. gentleman referred to it, but his explanation was not strictly in accord with the report made by the captain :
The only thing, in our opinion, that can be done to test the route is this: after the steamer Northumberland stops running, place the Stanley at Summerside andhave her all ready and let her remain there until the board ice in the vicinity of Cape Tormentine breakwater is sufficiently strong: then a landing can be made on the ice. This has been done at Souris and Georgetown on several occasions.

The Stanley was held at Summer-side for ten days to make daily trips between that port and Cape Tormentine. There were no mails, no passengers, and no facilities at the Tormentine side to advance the communication. About the 1st of Janu-ry, when the Stanley was withdrawn, the very conditions laid down in the captain's report existed : the ice had formed, and there was no difficulty in landing mails and passengers. The hon. gentleman refers to the smallpox scare. We know how important it is to the people of Prince Edward Island to have this communication. There is to-day in Ottawa a case of smallpox ; but must this city on that account be cut off Mr. COCHRANE.
from communication with the outside world ? Some smallpox may have existed in the county of Westmoreland in the vicinity of Cape Tormentine ; but the nearest case was six miles away from the Cape, and there was no danger. Mails and passengers could have been landed at Summerside without difficulty. But through some oversight the boat was taken away-it cannot have been on account of the smallpox scare. I noticed in a paper a day or two ago that when the minister was at Charlottetown, the board of trade of that city waited upon him with a memorial, asking him to leave the steamers Stanley and Minto on the route between Georgetown and Plctou in order to relieve the great congestion of freight at those points. What was the fact ? The two boats were stuck in the ice hard and fast for a week or ten days, and could not relieve the congestion of freight. If one of the boats had been left on the route between Georgetown and Pictou, and the other placed between Summerside and Cape Tourmentine and $1,000 had been spent on improvements at Cape Tormentine, there would not have been any congestion. When the Stanley was at Summerside she had on board a full cargo of coal, and still she was able to come to that port and discharge part of the coal, and make daily trips between there and Cape Tormentine. I think there has been some misunderstanding or bungling, or we would have a service between Summerside and Tormentine to-day.

I promised that an experiment would be made ; but I warned the board of trade when I made the promise that inasmuch that there were no terminal facilities at Tormentine for the landing of the Stanley, the experiment would be made under disadvantageous circumstances, and I doubted that it could be made successfully. But they pressed for it, and the experiment was made. The steamer was released for a variety of reasons which I have stated to the committee. The smallpox may have been one of them ; the absence of terminal facilities at Tormentine was another. While I do not want personally to call in question the opinions of those who believe that a route can be established there, I may state that when I crossed the other day in an open boat from Traverse to Tormentine, I found the pier at Tormentine completely covered with ice to a height of nearly thirty feet ; so that even if the Stanley were running there, it would have been absolutely impossible for her to have gone near that pier. I do not want to throw cold water on the experiment. I promised that it would be made ; and the boat was not taken from Summerside until after the captain had reported to me that he had spent two or three houis in getting out, and

that if the frost had become harder he would never have got out. I telegraphed back to him to use the best judgment he could, and to continue the test until he concluded that it was not possible to make the trip. I did not order him away without using the best judgment I could, and I think the hon. gentleman agrees with me.

As to the practice, we contradict his statement, because we say that the late government purchased practically all their supplies by tender. Has the hon. gentleman expended this money in the interests of the country as he promised us when given the vote ? Turn to the Auditor General's Report of last year and you will see that the bad practice, to which I drew attention time and time again, and which the hon. minister promised he would remedy, has continued and even become intensified. I find on page 8 that twenty-four bushels of onions were purchased for the steamer Aberdeen at a $1.50 per bushel, and each of the steamers uses the same quantity. I would ask any farmer if $1.50 per bushel for onions is a price this government ought to pay. But that is not all. $1.50 per bushel is paid for turnips and the same price for carrots, and 31 cents per pound for beans. Would anybody else pay these prices?
Then, take this new steamer Minto, my hon. friend had a political heeler in Montreal to whom he wanted to give $1,000 or more. This was B. .1. Coghlin, whom everybody knows as Barney Coghlin.

Some customs officers are careful and some are careless ; and, in the latter case, beyond the name of the boat, her tonnage and a few essential items, the matter is passed over. My suggestion is that there should be an officer to be called inspector of registrations. No additional expense would be incurred, it seems to me ; for some gentleman now in the Customs Department, who does not have too much to do and who is familiar with the work, would be assigned to this duty. The effect of his work would be to secure uniformity as well as greater care in the registration of vessels. Although the expense would be greater in the Department of Marine and Fisheries, it would be less in the Customs Department, and there would be less money spent than there is to-day. Of course the vote asked here, $500, is not a very large amount; and, looking at the Auditor General's Report, I see that only about $200 spent last year is properly chargeable to this item of the estimates. But I think that better service would be rendered if it was put under the charge of some man in the employ of the Marine and Fisheries Department, and if it were provided that all the registration, both inland and ocean, were systematized and better kept.

There seems to me no reason for nibbling at it, as the government are doing, when the coast line of this country is considered. The amount expended is only about $4,000, because the rest of this vote is in salaries, and you have a high class man whose salary is near the appropriation outside the amount spent. This work was long ago completed with the United States, on both the Pacific and At-

lantie coasts, and completed In India, and in the British Isles. With iron and steel ships, and with the growth of these steamers in size and all that sort of thing, it is a most necessary work. Take, for instance, the question of the insurance rates. While it is true that the ordinary seaman and the ordinary mariner of the smaller class of vessels have very little concern about the result of these surveys of the tides, the officers in command of all the large oceangoing steamers are required to understand them, and it takes a technical training to understand them. But it seems to me a disgraceful thing that we should proceed so slowly. It is a smaller vote now than I was able to get at the initiation of the work. I know there is very little general interest taken in it-we have discussed that already. Some rough and ready seamen think that because they have got along so well without these tables, which many of them cannot understand, it is merely a scientific fad. But one need only to refer to the Admiralty in England, to the leading men in connection with shipping there, and also to the official hydrographic staff of the United States, and the work in India, to understand that these surveys are of tremendous importance. Now the government is committed to the principle, they are carrying it on, the $4,000 is a mere bagatelle. I am glad to see that assistance is being given, but I would be far more pleased if, in addition to that, the hon. gentleman were to take a substantial increase, which this official and his assistants could spend to advantage. He has no ships, he has no facilities such as are required. I do not think the hon. gentleman will find that the United States, or India, when they were dealing with this work, made such slow progress, or satisfied themselves with so small an appropriation. I would be glad if the hon. gentleman could expedite that work in accordance with its importance.

We have tidal stations at different places on the Bay of Fundy and along the coast of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, for gauging the rise and fall of the tides, and the data ascertained at these different tidal stations are taken and tabulated at the head office here by Mr. Dawson and his assistants. We were some years behind in this work, and Mr. Dawson intimated to me two or three years ago that unless he could get these returns properly tabulated and printed in a book, it was no use collecting them at all. So some additional clerks were given him for the purpose of tabulating these statistics gathered at the different stations, and when they are tabulated they are sent home to the Hydrographic Office in Great Britain, and printed in a book. I think last year I brought down a copy of the book, a very large book, showing the rise and fall of the tides at these different stations. From this data so gathered, tide tables are prepared by Mr. Dawson, showing the tide at different harbours in different ports, so as to be of use to the mariners, showing them when the tide rises, when it falls, when it is half tide, when full tide, with the depth of the tide, and so on. It was necessary to employ these additional clerks in order to utilize the information which was being gathered, and which, until it was tabulated, was useless.

McDOUGALL, A.G.",,"It seems to me very strange that on February 2, the Minto crossed over to the island with the last mails before being locked up in the ice, and that ten or twelve days elapsed before we had a crossing with the mails at the Capes. If this service was organized, why was it not given. During the late election when I was campaigning in that portion of the district, my opponent was using the mail service to his advantage, saying that it would be duly equipped and organized and ready to perform the service. We find that from February 2, to February 12, there were no mails to or from Prince Edward Island, and the Board of Trade of Summer side, had to ask the post office inspector at Charlottetown, to ascertain if anything could be done to forward their mails by ice boats. They finally came to their senses and allowed this to go on. I cannot understand why this was not done at first. We did not have any mails from the province of Prince Edward Island, until the 13th February, and if this service was organized it is very strange that the mails were not brought over. We asked about this the other day in the House, and the hon. Postmaster General got up and in a very light manner said : You will get information about your mails when the hon. Minister of Marine returns. We know from the papers that the hon. Minister of Marine and Fisheries had a very thrilling time getting across. That may interest the hon. minister and his friends as an adventure, but it has nothing to do
with the commercial facilities of Prince Edward Island.

Nobody understands more clearly than I do, why you did not have mails between Prince Edward Island and the mainland for 12 days. It was for the simple reason that a violent storm was raging during which no boat could cross. I was imprisoned myself. No one could desire to leave the island more earnestly than I did, but I could not get away. I went once or twice to the cape to see if I could get across, but the captain would not start, and the judgment of the captain's was right. They could not start. The boats started out at the earliest possible moment they could cross. The opposition boats crossed one day from New Brunswick to Prince Edward Island. They went during a north-west wind. The next day our boats crossed from the Island.

In order to allow of the completion of certain somewhat lengthened researches, the marine station was not moved from its location on Passa-maquoddy Bay, near St. Andrews, N.B., though the proposal to tow the building round the coast, to the Nova Scotia shore, was fully discussed at the meeting of the board of management held in June. The great importance of the fisheries and of complex fishery problems along the eastern shores of Nova Scotia, around the Gut of Canso, and the coast of Cape Breton, weighed with the board in considering the proposal to have this movable station conveyed to a new temporary site. A final decision will be arrived at at the next meeting of the board, early in February.
These scientific gentlemen are prosecuting their investigations into the biology of fish and publishing the results every year. They propose to continue that so long as they are given this assistance. We promised that this vote should be given them for three or four years, and the time is not yet up, during which the assistance is to be given.

Hon. WILLIAM ROSS (Victoria, N.S.) In connection with this item I would like to make a few observations on the salaries paid to lighthouse keepers in general. I do not think that any system has been adopted in Canada to classify the lighthouse keepers as regards the salaries paid them. In the United States-I am now speaking of Maine and Massachusetts-the lighthouses are classified and the salaries regulated accordingly. With ns, the keeper of a revolving light on an island several miles from the shore gets $400 a year. It is impossible for

liim to keep that light going all the time without assistance, and that assistance must be paid. In the United States these assistants get $600. In our wealthy Dominion the keeper gets $400, and perhaps the next keeper to him. who has a fixed light, gets the same salary. I do not think that there has ever been any regular system or rule applied to the salaries of lighthouse keepers by any government since confederation. If, for instance, a lighthouse is erected at a particular place, and the representative of the county has influence enough with the government, the salary may be fixed at $500, while another place where the representative may not be so influential, the salary may be less. Let this House fancy the condition of a man on an island, keeping a light going all winter, with the assistance of one man, and very often obliged to find his own fuel, and receiving only $400. I think this is a subject which the lion. Minister of Marine and Fisheries should take into his consideration. I was disposed at first to ask for a committee of the House to deal with the whole subject, because as it stands at present it is most unsatisfactory. I have in my hands the resignation of a lighthouse keeper on an island, because it is impossible for him to remain there at the miserable salary he gets. A man in the same position in Maine or Massachusetts gets $1,000. I am bringing this subject to the notice of the minister in the hope that some improvement will be made ; because the present condition of things existed before he took charge of the department, and is likely to continue unless he deals with it.

McDOUGALL, A.G.",,"I am very glad the hon. member has brought this matter to the attention of the House ; but I think he is labouring under an erroneous impression with regard to one fact. He says he has in his hands the resignation of one gentleman who is receiving $400 a year for keeping a lighthouse. All I can say is that that is the only resignation of a lighthouse keeper that has been presented to the department within five years because of insufficient salary. At the present moment there are two vacancies in the maritime provinces, and there are no less than a dozen applicants for each light. A good deal of what my hon. friend says may be true. There may be a case here and there where the salary of a lighthouse keeper is hardly commensurate with the labour he has to perform ; but it must be remembered that these people are free of all taxes, house rent, and expense for fuel and light, and that they get $400 cash in addition. There are not many parts of the country where that would be considered bad payment. I would be sorry to say that in every case it is adequate payment. My hon. friend seems to think that these salaries are fixed in some Mr. ROSS (Victoria).
hap hazard way. I beg to assure him that that is not the case. The same officer who has advised the Minister of Marine for many years past with regard to the salaries to be attached to these offices, is in the department to-day. You cannot fix the same salary for Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Cape Breton, that we have to pay on the Great Lakes or in British Columbia. What would be considered an adequate salary in the maritime provinces would be considered utterly inadequate in British Columbia and in the far-off parts of the province of Ontario. The chief engineer who advises me in these matters is very careful to consider the circumstances when a new light is established, and to fix the salary with reference to the location and the work that has to be done. Political influence is very rarely, if ever attempted, in connection with the salaries paid. 1 have no hesitation in saying that a member for a district occasionally seeks to obtain for a lighthouse keeper an increase of salary or a greater salary than the department thinks should be paid; but we cannot give way to these influences. We must remember that there is a large army of these lighthouse keepers, and once you depart from the well-established rule that a certain salary should be attached to a certain light, you get away from your moorings, and every lighthouse keeper in the [DOT]Dominion would want an increase. The greatest care must be exercised in these matters. I never attempt to shut the door on any member of parliament who wishes to make representations as to the salary paid for any pai'ticular light ; and I will say this for the officers in charge, that whenever it is represented to them that a mistake has been made-which will happen to most men at times-and that a particular salary is too low, they are always ready to take the case into consideration. It is all very well to talk of increasing the salaries of the lighthouse keepers of this Dominion; but if you once began, you would have to go through the whole list, and it would become a very serious matter. If my hon. friend represents to me the case of any one lighthouse keeper who for the work he is doing gets less than he ought, his representations will receive the most favourable consideration at my hands. I shall be glad to sit down with him and consider the case he refers to ; but my experience is that it is not prudent to give way to these constant demands that are being made for increases to the salaries of lighthouse keepers throughout the Dominion.

McDOUGALL, A.G.",,"I heartily agree with what the hon. gentleman has said. Having given a good deal of attention to that subject, I am satisfied that a revision on the lines suggested by the hon. member for Victoria would land us into an expenditure on annual salaries for light-

liouse keepers of about a million dollars instead of $200,000. The number of lighthouses Is, of course, steadily increasing on account of our enormous coast line and lake border, and we could not afford to go into an expenditure on the same scale as the United States. In the United States, besides, the policy is entirely different. They have an unlimited fund to draw on, for the salaries of their lighthouse keepers is a tax on foreign shipping. Our policy, however, is to furnish our lights free and keep our port dues as low as possible and make no invidious distinction against foreign shipping.
We have been very successful in getting the best men for this class of work, and I cannot recollect of any case of a lighthouse keeper having resigned because his salary was not sufficient. No doubt if there was a revision, it would be found that the department could cut down some of the excessive salaries and still get good men, because irregularities, such as those mentioned by the hon. member for Victoria, have crept in, through political pressure mainly, during a long period of years.
I would like to ask the hon. minister whether this practice does not obtain, namely, when a vacancy takes place, of giving the new appointee a smaller salary than his predecessor to begin with.

The new man comes in at a salary considerably below that of his predecessor, and after a year or two, when he has proved his fitness, he gets an increase of $50 or perhaps $100 gradually until he reaches the old rate.

I do not admit at all that the St. Lawrence route is not properly lighted. I do not mean to say that we cannot spend more money on that route, but I have crossed the Atlantic with five or six of the best sea captains who have ever sailed out of Montreal and have put this question to each one. I told each one that I was putting the question in my official capacity as

Minister of Marine, and intended to use bis answer, and on tbe last occasion I bad tbe good fortune of baying two of my colleagues present. Tbe question X put was tbis : Do you know of any aid to navigation between Montreal and Belle Isle wbicb is now wanting, wbicb you would recommend being put there, or any aid to navigation now there wbicb you think ought to be improved. In each case tbe answer was no. The last gentleman to whom I put tbe question, tbe captain of the Parisian, qualified bis answer by saying : You know, I think tbis light at Point D'Amour in tbe Straits of Belle Isle, has bad something coming over it tbe last few months, and you should send an inspector to see what is the matter. I replied that with a naked eye I could not see anything wrong, but would send an inspector down tbe first thing in the spring. I do not mean to say that no improvement can be made, and before tbe supplementaries are through, we may have a special vote on this subject. We spent $40,000 to $45,000 in building a permanent pier at the Traverse and erecting a light there last year, which has been of the greatest possible benefit to the shipping interest. Instead of having a lightship there, we have this permanent light. When the cold came on and the ice formed, the lightship had to be* taken away, or it would be carried away by the ice altogether. With a permanent pier and permanent light there we are enabled to prolong the period of navigation for some time with safety. It is now under consideration-and I may say that personally I favour it-to construct a permanent pier at the other end of the Traverse, about two miles and a half further down. It will cost $75,000 or $80,000. If I can get the approval of my colleagues, and if the Finance Minister is able to grant it, I may ask the approval of the House, at a future time for the vote. There may be other large votes for the improvement of the navigation of the St. Lawrence, besides this. Anything that is submitted to me and which I can be satisfied is a real improvement, will be willingly accepted by me. For. I recognize the vast importance of that St. Lawrence river trade, and the absolute necessity of avoiding cheese-paring in our expenditure upon it to put it in the most effective condition. I do not hesitate to say that I am desirous of going as far as anybody else, short of extravagance or useless expenditure, in recommending the use of every dollar that is necessary to place the navigation of that route in the very best condition. If there are aids to navigation still needed, I wish to put them there ; if any that are there are defective, I wish to improve them. I am willing to listen to suggestions from any side of the House. The subject is under consideration, and I may have some additional votes in the supplementary estimates.

The deepening of the canals has been carried out under the directions of the Minister of Railways and Canals, and they will need to be lighted with gas buoys, because it would be impossible to navigate them unless they were lighted by night as well as day. The remarks of my hon. friend and colleague, the Minister of Railways and Canals, had reference to that part of the route. I think I am correct in saying that gas buoys have already been ordered to a large amount, and a great many of them will be in place this summer.

McDOUGALL, A.G.",,"I desire to call the attention of the minister to the case of one Robert Grey, late lighthouse keeper at Entrance Island. He entered the service in 1876 and did not leave until 1897. The reason he left was that his health gave way. He sent in his resignation, accompanied by certificates of two doctors, stating that his health had given way. He had been paying into the superannuation fund for many years, and after resigning made application for his pension, but from that time up to the present he has never had any word from the department whatever. He was twenty-one years in the service, and I do not believe anything was ever said against him ; I believe he did his duty faithfully and well during the whole of that time. His salary for the first seventeen years of his service was $600, then it was raised to $900 a year, owing to the fact that a fog alarm was added to the light. It seems to me an extraordinary thing that when a man has been in the service as long as that, and has done his duty well, and has been paying into the superannuation fund, that he cannot even get an answer from the department or get his pension. He is a very poor man, he has no money whatever now. He has been kept by relatives, and, as I say, he has not been able, up to the present time, to get any information from the department in regard to the reason why his pension is not paid. I hope the hon. gentleman will look into the case and see that the pension is properly paid to him. I do not know how much it is, but it should be paid to him at once, and paid as long as he lives.

McDOUGALL, A.G.",,"The reason that I speak is that the hon. minister, in referring to the list, read one or two items for maintenance at a lighthouse at Middle Ground. I assume that no maintenance will be required, unless it is intended to build a lighthouse there. This lighthouse, if built, will be to replace one at Point Pelee, which was burnt a year or so ago. A discussion has arisen in regard to where that lighthouse should be built. I understand that the department has decided that it would be rebuilt at Middle Ground, and I am informed that that is not the best place to have the lighthouse. This is certainly the most important lighthouse of any between Duluth, or Chicago and Kingston. More vessels are interested in this point than any other on the upper lakes. They say that Middle Ground is not the best place at which to build a lighthouse, and I understand that strong representations have been made to the hon. minister in that regard. It is perhaps important that a lighthouse should be put at Middle Ground, but if so there should be two lighthouses at that place. It is called Middle Ground because it is land

lying between Pelee Island and Point Pelee itself. If one lighthouse is built there, the other one ought to be built at Point Pelee, on what is called South-east Shoal, which is just near there. That is the one that will best serve the marine interests. I am told that there was a deputation of mariners down, and probably they had an interview with the minister upon that point. If so, it might be very satisfactory, and in the public interest, if the minister could say that he has been convinced that Middle Ground is not the best place to adopt, but that if he intends to build one at Middle Ground, he will have one built at South-east Shoal on Point Pelee itself. This is a very important matter, and I know that a great many people are interested in it and anxious to know at the earliest moment what the department intends to do. I am satisfied that 'the best interests of navigation will not be served by a lighthouse at Middle Ground, which will not answer the purpose at all. It will be good enough as far as it goes, but it is not the best place. It is not as good a place as to build it exactly on the spot where the one was destroyed. But better still would it be to put it on South-east Shoal, and better still would it be if there were two lighthouses, one on Middle Ground and one on South-east Shoal.

Last season when I asked for a vote, I brought down a chart, and the matter was argued and debated. The different locations where it was proposed that this lighthouse should be built were considered, and Middle Ground was preferred. I said in the House that the department had received petitions from a large majority of the captains of the craft in reference to the location, stating their opinion that the proper place to build the lighthouse was in the Middle Ground. I speak under correction, but I think that with two exceptions, they were unanimous in believing that Point Pelee was not the proper place, but that Middle Ground was the proper place. In addition to the opinion of the mariners, the captains of vessels, there was the opinion of the chief engineer, which was thoroughly concurrent, and there was no opinion of any weight or moment advocating the construction of this lighthouse at Point Pelee. There were very serious objections against building it there.

He has been there for a number of years and his salary has been $80 a year. I think he applied for an increase and, as he is a remarkably capable and efficient man and as he will have more work to do, I hope the minister will see his way clear to give him an increase when the additional light is put there. I think the making of the range light is the proper thing to do and will be appreciated by the people in the locality. Some think that the light on the end of the dock should be raised. I do not know whether it should be raised or not, but I think that the putting in of the range light will be an improvement.

My own opinion was that no promise had been made by the Minister of Marine, nor do I think that any such promise had ever been made. I merely draw attention to the fact to show the gross abuse of the expenditure of public

money for election purposes. There is no doubt the government candidate gained greatly by announcing the prospect of this expenditure, because he succeeded in getting a larger vote there than was usually obtained by a candidate of that party ;
I have no doubt the real intention was to mislead the electors. I quite believe that the whole thing was gotten up merely to influence the election. However, if the hon. minister does decide to build a lighthouse there, it will be very much appreciated by the electors of that section.

We, therefore, have in new Ontario an inspector, we have an inspector in Ontario, resident in Toronto, whose jurisdiction extends over the whole of Lake Erie and part of Lake Huron, and then we have an inspector in the eastern part of Ontario. We have two inspectors for Quebec, so that, having to pay for the inspectors and their travelling expenses, a matter of $9,000, was incurred more than was at first anticipated.

On the contrary, there has- been a disposition on the part of the provincial government to arrogate-if that is not an improper word-powers with regard to these regulations, which I do not think they possess. They undertook to pass regulations supplementary to ours, contending that as the proprietor of the fisheries, they had a right to make supplementary regulations. We challenge that right entirely, pointing to the words in the fishery judgment stating that the sole and exclusive right to make regulations relating to the fisheries is vested in the Dominion. That is our contention. We have taken the opinion of the Justice Department on it once or twice, and we have no reasonable doubt as to the righteousness and legality of the ground we stand upon in that regard. But there has been more or less friction. We pointed out to the Ontario government that in an Act which they passed on the subject, one or two sections went beyond their powers, because in them they took power to pass regulations which we contend is vested exclusively in the Dominion. But generally speaking, I have no complaint at all to make as to the manner in which the Ontario government and their officers administer the regulations which we pass. With
certain reservations, I think they are doing fairly well.

Their lordships have already noticed the distinction which must be borne in mind between rights of property and legislative jurisdiction. It was the latter cnly which was conferred under the heading, ' Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries,' in s. 91. Whatever proprietary rights in relation to fisheries were previously vested in private individuals or in the provinces respectively, remains untouched by that enactment. Whatever rights might previously have been lawfully made by the provinces in virtue of their proprietary rights could lawfully be made after that enactment came into force. At the same time, it must be remembered that the power to legislate in relation to fisheries does necessarily, to a certain extent, enable the legislature so empowered to affect proprietary rights. An enactment, for example, prescribing the time of the year during which fishing is to be allowed, or the instruments which may be employed for the purpose (which it was admitted the Dominion legislature was empowered to pass) might very seriously touch the exercise of proprietary rights, and the extent, character and scope of such legislation is left entirely to the Dominion legislature. The suggestion that the power might he abused so as to amount to a practical confiscation of property, does not warrant the imposition by the courts of any limit upon the absolute power of legislation conferred. The supreme legislative power in relation to any subject-matter is always capable of abuse, but it is not to be assumed that it will be improperly used.
That was brought out much more strongly in the argument on the interruption of the counsel, when Lord Herschell made an observation directly on the illustration which counsel was making on the basis of that license svstem.

draw a distinction between a general license to fish and a license to fish in a particular locality. The latter would be a matter affecting the proprietary right.

The revenue collected from British Columbia was four times more than that collected from New Brunswick, and yet the expenditure in New Brunswick was one and three-quarter times that expended in British Columbia. And while the revenue from British Columbia was more than ten times that of Nova Scotia, Nova Scotia had twice as much expended in that province as British Columbia.

The object was to secure support for the government, but it did not have that effect. The time when the fishing is going on is not the time to protect the fisheries. The time when watchfulness should be used is during the spawning season. But, when the men are fishing, do not put on a force of camp followers to watch them at their work every day. As I have said, the hon. minister is losing prestige among the fishermen by using the men in this way. Merely that he may hand over'the loaves and fishes of government patronage to the men who were wandering in the wilderness for eighteen years hungering for the flesh pots of office. This may be a growing time, but the day may come when the government will require every dollar they are now throwing away in this reckless manner. I had the honour to be inspector of fisheries for Prince Edward Island for a number of years. In 1895 I found the amount placed at my disposal quite sufficient to protect the fisheries. Since then, as I say, the expenditure has increased a hundred per cent and it has been increased for a corrupt purpose, to influence the electors.

It seems to me that the salary is very small in proportion to the travel. There seems to be very little bread, to a monstrous deal of sack in this case.

to the hon. gentleman this apparent an-nomaly, but it is all right. A man is paid a certain sum as guardian or overseer of a certain district. If he sits at home and does nothing, he might as well not have been appointed. If his district is a large one he should travel long distances. He must keep a record of all the travelling he does, where to, and the number of miles. He must make a return, and this is checked by the officers of the department. A man cannot be expected, for $50 a year, to take his horse and carriage out or to travel by rail or boat at his own expense. Therefore, the department allows so much a mile for travelling fees. The law allows payment only for mileage actually travelled bona fide in the discharge of the duties of the office. The question is whether we have a good check upon these returns, and the officers in the department think we have.

The hon. gentleman sees it is not a matter of whether the officials of the Ontario government carry out their duties to their superiors that I am concerned with ; they may collect their fees or they may not, they may issue licenses properly or they may not, that is not the point that I am concerned with. The point I am concerned with is this : Are the regulations that this department makes from time to time the proper regulations and,

secondly, if tliey are, how are they observed by the fishermen ? Now, I must have somebody to inform me from time to time whether those regulations which are made by the department as to times, and seasons, and methods of fishing, are proper regulations or whether they should be amended. It is not the duty of the Ontario officials to do that, and if I have not got an official there to do it, it will not be done at all. These officials make reports from week to week, not how the Ontario officials discharge their duties, but how the Ontario fishermen observe our regulations, and whether those regulations are right or whether they ought to be amended. From time to time we receive our information from our inspectors, which we transmit to the Ontario officials for their information, and, therefore, we keep in touch one with the other. It is not our fault if these apparent anomalies exist between the powers of the Ontario government and the powers of the Dominion government ; the Privy Council is responsible for that, for its declaration of what we formerly supposed was not the law. So, I say, it would not be good policy on the part of this government to withdraw altogether from the great province of Ontario the presence of two or three officials, who travel about from week to week and fortnight to fortnight to keep the department here informed as to whether our regulations are good and proper, and whether they are being properly observed. Now, if I found out from the reports of my inspectors that these regulations were not being observed, it would become my duty to appoint officers to enforce them. It is part of the duty of these inspectors to"" enforce them if they come face to face with any breach of them. On view they could convict and punish any offender against the regulations, and it is their duty to do so : and if they fail to do so we must appoint others to do it, in case it is reported to us that breaches become numerous. So far we have no material grounds of complaint. Of course complaints are always coming in, being investigated, and disposed of ; and, speaking generally, we are getting along fairly well. There must be some friction existing between the Ontario government and the Dominion government, each not being quite sure where the line of their duty ends and where the duty of the other begins. However, this will adjust itself, it is adjusting itself now from season to season. I think my hon. friend would be well advised not to ask us to withdraw the only officials we have there, but to ask us to keep down the expenditure to the lowest possible notch.

The hatchery which as been started at Gaspe is a combined lobster and salmon

liatchery. Lobster fisheries are entirely under the control of the Dominion, being a deep-sea fish ; and salmon may be con-siderd, while it is in the river, to be a provincial fish, but in the sea it is a Dominion fish. However, the policy in the Dominion has not been altered in respect of fish hatcheries by reason of the Privy Council decision. We have gone on, at all events, and parliament seems very generally to have approved of the fishery expenditure. I think it is money well spent. A large number of those engaged in the lobster fisheries believe that a large number of the small lobsters, innumerable almost, three, four and five inches in size are the result of the Pictou lobster hatcheries. Whether it is so or not, I cannot positively assert, but their presence in very large numbers within a reasonable area from the place where the spawn are deposited by the fish hatchery officer leads to the reasonable conclusion that they are the product of the fish hatcheiy. Taking it all in all, I think the money is well spent, and unless there is a very strong opinion expressed in parliament against the continuance of the expenditure, I should be disposed to advise its continuance.

At the conclusion of the fishing season, in sending in the annual report of the Frog Pond feezer for 1900, Mr. Larkin, the president, further writes :
Permit me now, at the close of our season's business, to enumerate or place before you some of the benefits derived by our people from having a constant supply of fresh bait. Last year (1899) our cove, with the same number of boats and men engaged in hand and ' set ' lining, took some 95,000 pounds codfish, hake and haddock. During this season the weather was fine ; we had very few mackerel along our shores, and so the men devoted the greater part of their time to the pursuit of codfish, hake and haddock. A great deal of time was lost trying to procure a supply of bait. During this season (1900) our men in this cove have landed about 210,000 pounds codfish, hake and haddock; 9-10ths of all those fish were caught with frozen bait. Men

1604,ca.proc.d.1901-02-22.5.8.1.1,1901-02-22,,,,stagedirection,,,,"Ballentyne's Cove, N.-S.-Commenced operations on April 25, 1899, and fourteen tons herring were frozen and stored. The fresh bait season was exceptionally good, better than for many years past. Mackered struck in early and provided an excellent supply of bait. In consequence, the fishermen did not require the frozen supply. Owing to neglect to ice the storage room frequently enough, two tons of herrings were spoiled. The charge was ultimately converted to other uses. The presence of the freezer was, however, a guarantee that bait would at all times be available. This freezer will be operated by the fishermen during the coming season.
Frog Pond, P.E.I.-Commenced operations in April, 1900, and has proved a great boon to this fishing settlement. The president of this association, writing about the middle of the past fishing season, states : ' I am buying most or nearly all of the codfish caught in this vicinity, and am keeping a record of the kind of bait they were caught with. Our fish books show over one-half our total catch has been caught with frozen bait. Furthermore, were it not for the constant supply of bait insured to the fishermen by the bait freezer, not one-half as many people would engage in the busines for the simple reason that it would not pay the men to engage in this business -without the certainty of a constant and sure supply of bait. I feel quite certain that we are on the eve of a new era in the codfishing business around our shores Sir LOUIS DAVIES.
who in the first season had not any great faith in frozen bait, kept some nets out; sometimes they got a baiting, sometimes only part of a baiting. Those people tested the matter thoroughly, and so satisfied did they become with the frozen bait that they took their nets ashore. We have some very practical and observant fishermen in our cove, and they declare that so long as a supply of frozen bait is to be had they will not set any nets during codfishing season, the supply of bait from nets, they say, is no better when had. Again, there is no certainty of obtaining bait every fine day.
I might say just here that we had twelve shares of stock unsold when we met on the 22nd. During the meeting we offered them for sale ; within two minutes they were all taken-taken by fishermen who had a share each before. This will give you some idea of the faith and estimation which our fishermen have of frozen bait, and the benefits derivable therefrom.
You will observe on looking over the sheets where a record of bait taken and issued appears that our fishermen knocked off fishing early this year. The reason for this is that this has been an unusually stormy season. In all my experience I have never known anything like it. With weather such as we had last year (1899) we would have certainly doubled our catch. Another cause for more fish, codfish. &c., not being taken was that in the month of July and the early part of August mackerel struck in -quite plentiful ; our men paid considerable attention to that branch of fishing at the expense of the other.

I may say for myself that I am more than ever convinced of the benefits derivable from having a bait freezer in our midst.
Alberton, P.E.I.-Commenced operations in May, 1900 ; ten tons of fish were frozen. The directors did not provide sufficient ice to carry the charge until fall, when the Caraquette fleet from New Brunswick make Tignish and Alberton their headquarters^ In consequence, no decisive results were obtained. Used locally, the bait gave satisfaction.
Port Hood Island, C.B.-This freezer was finished in October, 1900, and a supply of ice being available, a test charge of one and one-half tons of squid were frozen and used in December. The secretary of this association writs :
' We had our freezer completed about November 20, 1900. As we had some ice left over from last year, we transferred it to the new ice-house, and commenced freezing squid. We froze about 3,000 pounds on trays and in crates and kept them for future use ; the result was that after the middle of December there was no bait on the fishing ground, and the fishermen were glad to use bait from the freezer.
' Some boats caught over $100 worth of fish, using frozen bait, which they would not have caught if they had not bait from the freezer. One fisherman states that he earned his three shares in the freezer on New Year's Day, over and above his neighbours who baited on salt squid, fishing on the same ground and with more trawls than he had ; all were expert fishermen.
'The fishermen here were always doubtful about the value of frozen bait; now they are very favourably inclined towards our freezer, and expect great benefit from it next season. I also have frozen a quantity of haddock and codfish, and expect to supply fresh fish to Port Hood and vicinity during March and April.'
Neil's Harbour, Victoria County, C.B.-A freezer was built at this point by. private enterprise from the department's plans, and was not under the supervision of the department's inspectors. Mr. M. G. McLeod, who was principally interested, writes : ' Our Neil's Harbour cold storage did not prove a success owing to the ignorance and carelessness of our men. A lot of squid was packed in it, but in such large quantities that they got red before they froze. Had the squid been properly frozen they would have been worth at least 1,500 quintals of codfish to us.
' When we will get the Neil's Harbour storage to work well, it is sure to pay, and possibly better than any other cold storage in the province of Nova Scotia. It was not the fault of the cold storage that the squid did not keep well. The storage, I believe, is all right, and with some experience, will be worth thousands a year to our fishermen and ourselves. If the squid had kept in our storage last fall we would have more codfish stored away for winter than we could handle for drying next spring. Next year I hope we will be able to give a good report.'
In the report of the Fisheries Intelligence Bureau, under the direction of Commander O. G. V. Spain, for 1900, Messrs. A. N. Whitman & Sons, of Canso, N.S., remark : ' The laudable efforts of the Dominion government to establish bait freezers along the coasts are meeting with gratifying success, and it looks as though in a few years every fishing port of any importance would be supplied with one. Properly managed, they must materially add to the catch of fish.'

The ground of the objection taken then was that this measure interfered with private enterprise which would supply the want now supplied by the government. That is a very rosy report ; and if everything in it is true, there would seem to be no necessity for the government bearing any share of the cost of this undertaking. Another feature that was discussed-I am not attempting to criticise, but merely to state the objection raised in the former debate-was that this bait was sold to American as well as Canadian fishermen. I would like to ask the hon. gentleman if that is true, and if so, do the government feel bound to take the place of private enterprise in order to furnish bait to American fishermen ?
The MINISTER OF MARINE ANI) FISHERIES. The hon. gentleman will remember my stating last year that the greatest possible care would be taken not to interfere with commercial enterprise. In Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island there are many places where the fishermen congregate in fishing villages, and where there is no great inducement to prompt commercial men to undertake the establishment of freezers. Most of these will be built for the benefit of the fishermen themselves. Few, if any, will enter into Sir LOUIS DAVIES.
competition with the bait freezers established by such men as the Whitman Bros., for commercial purposes ; and I may say that the enterprise which the government have entered into has the warmest encouragement and support from such men as these. It cannot do other than increase largely the supply of fresh fish. I know of nothing which this government have put their hands to on a small scale calculated to produce better results than the assistance we have given to the bait freezers. Everywhere it is appreciated, and everywhere it is doing good. Of course, there are cases in which the licensed American fishermen may purchase bait, where the bait freezers choose voluntarily to sell it to them; but the unlicensed American fishermen cannot buy bait from the bait freezers or from any one else. Therefore, to the extent to which the licensed American fishermen could buy bait, it would be rather harsh, I take it, on our part to intervene and say we ought not to sell it to them.

FRASER.,,"I take this opportunity of placing before the members of the House, particularly the members from the west, the importance of this industry which the government are endeavouring to foster in this way. The line fishermen of the maritime provinces number about 20,000, and the annual catch of fish known as line-fish

amounts to about $8,000,000. We have altogether about 45,000 fishermen in the maritime provinces, who, it is estimated lose from thirty to sixty days each in the season for want of a constant supply of fresh bait. The aggregate loss of the fishermen of the maritime provinces on this account amounts altogether to 800,000 to 1,000,000 days of fishing in the year. The fishing industry is our second most important industry. Agriculture, poor as it is with us, is still our first industry. We hear a great deal of our lumber and mining industries in the east; but our fishing industry is far in advance of these in importance, I think more than equal to both combined. So that the House can readily understand that to make provision for overcoming so great a loss as 800,000 or 1,000,000 days of fishing is a matter of vital importance to the maritime provinces. We hear it frequently stated that the fishing population along our coasts is becoming depleted, a believe it is a fact that for years past the industry has been unremunerative. At the same time, our fishermen are large consumers, and very heavy contributors to the revenues. They use large quantities of imported goods and manufactured goods from the west, and their return from their catch of fish has to depend not on any benefit which the government can give them. They have to send their fish to the West Indies, to South America, to Brazil, and to the Mediterranean, in competition with the fish of the whole world. For these reasons the government were urged, some eighteen months ago, to take this step. We recognized that a cold storage system had been established for the benefit of the farmers of the western provinces and the province of Quebec, not only on shore but on sea- a cold storage system virtually extending from their farms to the consumers' tables in the old country ; and we urged that something in the same direction should be done for the fishermen. 1 happen to have been the promoter of this scheme, and I am entirely gratified at the success which it has achieved in so short a time. If hon. members will give it their support, we will not require a great appropriation to establish a pretty effective system all around the coast, from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the mouth of the St. Croix river. Perhaps from 100 to 110 small freezers will meet the requirements. A considerable number of gentlemen in the maritime provinces, who are well acquainted with the fishing industry, feel sure that this measure will enable our fishermen to realize anywhere from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 per annum more than they do at present. We expect also to establish a better class of cold storage cars, so that we may send our fish in good condition from the maritime provinces to the west, even as far as Chicago.
To-day we have not in Canada a cold storage' car equal in construction to many used by the Swift and'Armour firms in carrying their freight from Chicago to Portland and Boston. I may say that the Minister of Railways (Hon. Mr. Blair) has employed the expert who made these cars in the western states, to construct two at Moncton on the same plan. What we want is a car that will carry fish, apples and other perishable products without freezing them, and to-day we have not got in Canada a first-class cold storage car.
We may look forward soon to the time when the western part of our country will be populated to a far greater extent than it now is, and furnish a great market for fish, more particularly as the fish of the great lakes, in all probability, will not hold out. We have in our fishermen a large consuming population who are adding to the wealth of the country and contributing very largely to its revenue, and I ask gentlemen from the west, in particular, to take this matter up and give it their best consideration.
