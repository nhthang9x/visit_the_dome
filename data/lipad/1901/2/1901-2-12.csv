Unless the question is of really urgent importance, it is harldy regular to bring it up in this form. At the very outset, I wish to direct the attention of hon. members to the fact that it would be much more convenient if questions of ordinary importance were placed upon the Order baper. It would greatly facilitate the business of the House if this course were adopted.

From the year 1867 up to the year 1896, during a period of nearly thirty years, there were about twenty-five motions to adjourn the House made for the purpose of bringing a special subject before the House. However, during the last session of parliament there were no fewer than thirty-four motions of that character. It is only necessary to mention this to the House to show the change that has taken place, and I might be permitted to express the opinion that it would be more regular if these motions to adjourn the House were only made in connection with questions of the most urgent importance.

I desire to bring before this House, and before the country, the great fact transpiring in the United States to-day as to the control of railways. The railway mileage of that country is now passing into the hands of a most powerful syndicate. This syndicate controls most of the railways of the United States, and there is a dread that within two or three weeks there will not be one line of railway in the neighbouring republic which will not be controlled by Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Vanderbilt, Mr. Harri-man, Mr. Hill-whose name we hear a great deal of in Canada-and some others. These men have under their power now over $2,000,000,000 of railway capital, and not only that, but these same men control the banking institutions, they control the coal fields, they control the Standard Oil Company, and only last week they got control of the entire iron production of the United States.

It would not be very difficult for the powerful financial interests which Mr. Hill represents to secure a majority of the common stock of the great Canadian Pacific Railway.
Now, the point that I want to bring before the people of Canada and this House is this, that these men, who have obtained control of the railways of the United States, are in a position to-day to capture' the control of both the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway. I can go further : I believe that tracers are out to-day after the stock of these two railways, in order that Messrs. Morgan, Rockefeller, and the men associated with them may, if they think it necessary, get the control of these two Canadian roads ; and I call the attention of the people of this country to this fact, that less than $50,000,000 put on the stock market to-day will secure the control of the
Canadian Pacific Railway. Did this country put all the money which it has put into the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway in order to build railroads which might pass any day from the control of this country to the control of the United States ? What do we see happening at this moment ? These Canadian railroads, in connection with which the people of this country have spent so much money under reputed Canadian or English management, are to-day a menace to Canada. The Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway have announced that they intend to shape their policies to build up American cities, if necessary, at the expense of Cana,-dian cities. There is the great question before the people of this country. We were discussing platitudes yesterday in this House, but here is a definite question. The Grand Trunk to-day is antagonizing the city of Montreal, and I believe the Canadian Pacific is antagonizing the city of St. John. These two railroads tell the people of Canada, openly and above board, that they have no consideration for Canadian interests, but will, if it is in their own interests, direct their traffic to the United States. If that is the case to-day, how much worse will it be when Messrs. Morgan and Rockefeller and their associates go on the stock market and secure control of the Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific Railway ? I am not dealing in a generality, but am speaking of something that might happen to-morrow. My hon. friend from West Toronto (Mr. Osier) occupies a seat on the board of directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and he and Mr. Shaughnessy might attend a board meeting to-morrow and have an intimation made to them that the Canadian Pacific Railway had passed from the control of Canadians to the control of these gentlemen in New York.

The most significant thing that has happened in my time was the thing which Benjamin Disraeli accomplished not so many years ago in connection with the Suez canal. He made an arrangement with the bankers of the British government by which he had the necessary money placed at his disposal, and before anybody knew anything about it, the world woke up and learned that England owned the controlling shares of the Suez canal. That was a first-class investment, and one of the things resulting therefrom is that Egypt is to-day one of the most important and growing sections of the British Empire. I say that if we are alive to the danger which seems to overhang our country, this parliament, irrespective of party, will take the bull by the horns, and place Canada in a position, if necessary, to go on the stock

market and buy the control of these two great Canadian railroads. Here is the point : the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk, as owned and controlled to-day, actually antagonize our own country, our own ports, our own canals, our own river routes, our own fast Atlantic service-antagonize Canadian interests in every way. But if the state had control of these railways, they would be the complement of our canals, of the Intercolonial Railway, of our rivers and harbours, and they would be, what they are not now, national railways helping to build up this country.
Some hon. gentlemen on the other side of the House are disposed to make sport of this ; but I read only yesterday in an Ottawa paper that the Minister of Public Works (Hon. Mr. Tarte) proposes to extend the Intercolonial Railway across this continent so as to give the people of Canada some relief from the exorbitant rates charged by the Canadian Pacific Railway. I believe in that, if we cannot nationalize the Canadian Pacific ; but it will cost more to extend the Intercolonial across the continent to the other seaboard than it would to acquire today the control of the Canadian Pacific Railway. There is the present and immediate way of settling the transportation problem of this country ; there is the way to get a fast Atlantic service-to use the railways of Canada to build up our Atlantic ports ; and it can be done for less than $50,000,000. The country would not have to bear any more expense in connection with the bonds and the various investments of the railway than it bears to-day. It is the traffic that pays all these expenses. In fact, I believe, the capital could be converted to a 21 or 3 per cent basis instead of having to bear the rather high rates that prevail to-day. The country would benefit in that way and in a thousand other ways from such an action on our part. We should not for a single day longer allow the control of our railways, and it may be the control of our coal areas, to stand in danger of passing over to the capitalists of the United States. And there is something coming in the United States. I believe a revolution is imminent there. What is likely to happen was depicted the other day in a cartoon in a New York paper in which Uncle Sam was watching some boys-Morgan, Rockefeller and others-putting the railways into a bag, and he said to the boys. ' When you get them all into one bag, I intend to take them over.' That is the position of matters in the United States. There are great constitutional difficulties in the United States in the way of the government taking over the railways ; but in Canada all that is required is a resolution to be passed by this House, and the Minister of Finance (Hon. Mr. Fielding) ought to be able in twenty-four hours afterwards to make arrangements by cable in England to have the Mr. MACLEAN.
necessary money to buy the control of the railways. It is au easy thing for us to do. We have extended the Intercolonial Railway, and it is the best asset Canada has to-day. I am told the Minister of Railways (Hon. Mr. Blair) is in favour of extending the national railway. If he is, he is on good lines. The Intercolonial Railway must not end where it is to-day. The people have substantial grievances, which must be remedied, and the way to remedy them is to stop chartering railways and giving away to railway corporations the lands of the country.
Somebody is going to tell me that there will be corruption and maladministration attending this project. I would be prepared to pay a man like Mr. Hays, who is admitted to-day to be the first railway man in America, $100,000 a year, if necessary, to administer our railways absolutely for the benefit of the people and irrespective of party or political considerations ; and we can get such a man. Perhaps we could get three men to do the Work for a great deal less money. But what I am talking about is a serious present problem before the people of Canada, which may be forced upon their attention any day-a problem which must be solved, and to which immediate public attention should be directed; and we should have some statement from the government as to what they would do if they should wake up some morning and find that our two great Canadian railways had passed into the hands of that enormous syndicate in the United States which to-day controls nearly every mile of railway in that country, which controls every acre of coal lands, which controls the Standard Oil Company, which controls the iron output of the country, which control^ the banks. (Mr. Morgan is besides the greatest banker in the world to-day), and directing its energies against Canada and controlling our railways with the capital behind it, could wipe the name of Canada from off the face of the earth, and that is the only thing that could do it.

CLARKE WALLACE (West York).,,THE RAILWAY QUESTION.,,,"I think, Mr. Speaker, that this House is entitled to a little more information from the government than has been given us. The matter brought before our attention by my hon. friend from East York (Mr. Maclean) is one of momentous importance to the people of Canada. The right hou. the First Minister has either not been seized with its importance, or, for some other reason, is not prepared to make any statement about it.
But take the facts, as we know them, connected with this railroad question. We have had the information give us within the past few days that the Grand Trunk Railway has made the city of Portland its ocean seaport, not only for the winter months, but the whole year round. This magnanimous, generous and beneficent government built a bridge for this company in order to enable it to take its business away from Montreal to Portland, and the Grand Trunk Railway boasts that that bridge has been built without a dollar of cost to that company. I have always said in parliament, and this side of the House always protested that the bargain made with the Grand Trunk Railway and the Drummond County deal, was a most improvident one. But leaving the Drummond County Railway aside for
the moment and dealing simply with the Grand Trunk Railway, this government gave them sufficient money to enlarge the Victoria Bridge across the St. Lawrence and to carry that product, which we all desire should be shipped from the Canadian ports of Montreal or Quebec in the summer, and Halifax or St. John in the winter, to a foreign port. Now we have the important information from Mr. Reeves that the whole of that business in winter and summer is to be transported to Portland. The Grand Trunk Railway say that they have made enormous investments in Portland and ask: Are we to leave those investments idle? And they have been aided by the generosity-or rather I should say by the extravagance, the unjustifiable extravagance, of this government-to make Portland the winter and summer terminus of their road. Here is a most disastrous position of affairs. We have our Canadian cities down by the sea, Halifax and St. John, of which we are proud, and whose growth and increase we should do our best to develop. Then we have the city of Quebec, which is beginning to show- and we are glad to know it-signs of increased prosperity, and the great city of Montreal, the ocean port of Canada. Yet we are told to-day that the business of this country, so far as the Grand Trunk can do it, is to be carried past our doors into a foreign and hostile country. I protest that the government should have something to say about these matters rather than make the poor plea that it is inconvenient to bring them up, that we should adhere to the old rule and let the motion stand until to-morrow. when the House goes into Committee of Supply. In my opinion that is a most absurd proposition. You cannot move an amendment to the motion to go into supply because the government will then say: This is a want of confidence motion, and will call on all its supporters to vote it down without discussion. My hon. friend from East York (Mr. Maclean) has taken the proper course in bringing this matter to the attention of the House.
Then there is another question, which arises in a distant locality, but is closely connected with the one now before the House. We read from day to day that James J. Hill, of the Northern Pacific Railway, is acquiring possession of Canada's great coal fields, the Crow's Nest coal fields, and that he will apply to parliament for a charter to build a road into that district. It is true that the speech from the Throne gives us no enlightenment or information about this important matter, but we would like to know something about it. We would like to know whether the Crow's Nest coal fields, the greatest perhaps in the world today, are to be handed over to this rival corporation beyond the jurisdiction of the parliament of Canada or the government, which three or four years ago manipulated them in the interest of its friends.

There is another matter connected with this. We all remember when the right hon. the First Minister, at a banquet in the city of Toronto, was hailed as a great deliverer because he had got a telegram from Mr. Fielding, his Finance Minister, in England, stating that the Fast Atlantic steamship service was an accomplished fact- the business was concluded. Perhaps, I am mistaken in saying that the telegram was from the hon. Minister of Finance; it may have been from the hon. member for Quebec West (Hon. Mr. Dobell). At any rate, it was from some minister in England-but there are so many ministers in England at different times that we cannot keel) track of them. To-day, as I have said, we have a confession that there is to be no fast Atlantic line. And we have it further said that we do not need a fast Atlantic line. Why, of course not. If Portland, New York and Boston are to be the ocean ports for the Dominion of Canada, what do we want with fast steamers from Montreal, Quebec, Halifax, or St. John ? All these things seem to be going together; and we have a government in power to-day that, so far as we can see, do not realize their duty in relation to these matters. We wish to rouse the government and to make them realize that these are important questions and that we expect them to do their duty to the country with regard to them.

I imagine that the question raised by the hon. member for East York is one that we can discuss with better results if we abstain from partisan attacks upon the government for policy or action not directly bearing upon that question. It is possible that a better course could have been pursued by my hon. friend from East York in presenting this question to the House than that which he has pursued. But the question is before us norv for discussion; and it might be well to devote just a little time to it to call the attention not only of the House, but of the country to this important matter. I must confess that the position taken by my hon. friend from East York with regard to the imminence of a great crisis in this country in relation to monopolies and to transportation affairs is a position, perhaps, well taken. The absorption by a few individuals in the United States of the entire railway system of that country is a portentous fact; and the development and present condition of affairs in that country are of a character to challenge our attention. Results are being wrought out there which should be to us a warning as to the course which we shall pursue. Everything in the United States seems to tend to pass the leading Mr. WALLACE.

The organization of the railway trust follows fast on the steel trust. All the great railway interests of the United States are being absorbed by a few capitalists, and the position of the plutocracy threatens the best interests of the country. Half of the property in the United States is held by about twenty thousand individuals, and every conceivable kind of business seems to be legitimate prey for the trusts. The operation of these trusts must be inimical to the interests of the people at large. Transportation charges in the United States are often enormously beyond what they should be, if based upon the actual cost of operating the transportation lines. The same is true of telegraph charges. A few years ago, I looked up affairs in connection with the Western Union Telegraph Company, and I found that upon the enormous capital of $86,000,000, they were paying dividends at the rate of eight per cent. That capital covered only $16,000,000 of actual cost. That stock represented sixteen millions of money and the balance of water; but upon the whole of it the people of the United States were paying dividends of eight per cent. As to transportation, take the case of the New York Central, for instance. The stock has been watered from time to time, until that road, which is paying six percent upon its nominal capital, is paying nearly forty per cent upon its actual cost. Things go on in this way, and the people are plundered by the mono-plies and by the operations of these trusts and corporations. And now that this question is under discussion in this House, now that the discussion has been precipitated, it is our duty to consider whether we ought not to strive in some way to avert the calamities that are now falling upon the United States-whether we should not take some action in this country that will prevent the establishment of a great plutocracy, that, like a giant octopus will seize everything within its reach.
I rise merely to say as a member on this side of the House, that I think this is a question that deserves the greatest and fullest consideration on the part of the public men of Canada. Whether it is well that the government should absorb the railways, whether it is well to build an independent line and regulate rates by means of roads across the continent, as the government of the state of New York regulated rates by means of the Erie canal from tide-water to the lakes-these are questions deserving consideration; they are questions of a practical character to which we should devote

our best energies in order to find a solution that will be in the best interests of the country. I sometimes have had a fear that the government ownership of railways would lead to political corruption and to a condition of things not at all desirable. I do not know that that is necessarily the case. 1 believe the government might own the telegraphs of the country; and I would be in favour of the assumption by the government of that system at once. I am not sure, but that the government might go further in the interests of the people, and take charge of the transportation of the country as well. I do not give these as my views, but I do say that, with all the developments we see going on around us, with all the evils we see growing up, the time has come for the House to take these matters into serious consideration and to decide whether Canada cannot place herself in a position that shall avert the evils that have shown themselves among our neighbours to the south of us.

Sir Wilfrid Laurier), if any steps have been taken by the government to ascertain the truth of the reports that have been ventilated in the papers for some time as to the removal of the Grand Trunk Atlantic port from Montreal to Portland. The Dominion line which was largely subsidized by the government, as I understood, carries the mails; and the Grand Trunk is also greatly indebted to the government. As this matter has been before the public for some time I would like to ask the government whether they have taken any steps to ascertain what is being done by these two companies.

Of course, if that hon. gentleman takes the position that it is not expedient to go on with Supply until we have that report, I cannot take exception to his position. But, I ought to explain that the Auditor General, in the performance of what he believes to be his duty, brings his report down to a very late date and endeavours to include in it correspondence almost down to the very day of the meeting of parliament-certainly to a very recent date. The consequence is that his
report is completed late and must be hurriedly pushed ahead. We are now informed that the best that can be done is to have the report ready by Friday next.

The Department of Agriculture requested and urged the owners and agents of various steamship lines from Canadian ports to provide ventilation for the holds or other places in which apples were carried, by the use of fans or otherwise. A communication to that effect was sent to them under date September 29, 1897. The matter has been followed up every year since that date; and the various owners and agents were urged to provide ventilated accommodation for cheese also.
2.	In July, 1900, the Department of Agriculture offered a bonus of $100 towards the initial expense of fitting up each approved steamship, to be paid after the ventilating equipment had been in use for at least three voyages. Twenty-three steamers were fitted with exhaust fans to ventilate the holds wherein fruit and other perishable cargo was stowed. These were steamers of the Allan, Thomson and Donaldson lines. The steamers of the Dominion Line, the Elder-Dempster Lines and the Manchester Liners (Limited) are reported as being provided with only the ordinary ventilators.
3.	Agents of the department were stationed in Montreal and at the ports of London, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow, to observe and report on the loading and discharge of Canadian cargoes. The report indicates that the cargoes were delivered in better condition from the holds ventilated by exhaust fans than from other holds. The government intends to continue trial shipments of grapes.

List of school lands sold at public auction in Manitoba during last year, place of sale and name cf auctioneer and other officials in charge of the sale. The name of the purchaser, with the description and acreage of the respective lots purchased, price of sale per acre and amount paid on account. A list of the lots adjudicated but which were subsequently resold, name of first purchaser, price bid and at which adjudication was made; also, price at which sale of same lot was subsequently made, with name of purchaser.
He said:	It is a well-known fact, Mr. Speaker, that the school lands held for the province of Manitoba are managed by the Deparment of the Interior of the Federal government, and from time to time sales of portions of these lands are held. Many such sales have taken place in former years. During the past year several sales have taken place at different points, and it appears that speculators attended, and made bids on these lands although they did not intend to carry out their bargain, but rather expected to get the lands at a lower price when they were offered for sale again, and in some instances they actually did succeed in their expectations. I do not for one moment intend to blame the government for what has occurred, but at the same time there is something further to be done in those cases. An inquiry is now being proceeded with into the matter, and from the evidence adduced before the presiding judge it has been found that the system I have referred to has been carried out so extensively that the province of Manitoba will be at the loss of several thousand dollars. There is another phase of this case which constitutes a serious grievance. Bona fide settlers who intended to purchase these lands either to enlarge their own domain, or as farms for their children, have been ousted out of the opportunity of so purchasing by these speculators over-bidding them, and then after the bona fide intending purchaser had left the place the lands were again put up for sale and sold at a lower price than in the first instance. Evidence is daily being adduced before the presiding judge giving further instances of this kind of thing. I will not undertake to read that evidence, as it is rather long, and indeed as the inquiry has not yet been concluded, it would perhaps be premature to bring the matter before the House. I trust that as soon as this inquiry is completed and as soon as the government is convinced that there have been frauds perpetrated, that all these corrupt and fraudulent sales will be cancelled and that a chance will be given to bona fide settlers to purchase these lands, I am glad to know that an investigation has been ordered, because there undoubtedly has been something wrong Mr. FISHER.
going on. When this investigation is completed it will be the further duty of the government to rectify the wrong that has been perpetrated to the detriment of the bona fide settlers who intended to purchase those lands.

So soon as my attention was called to the fact that there were charges of irregularities in connection with the sale, steps were taken to order an investigation, and the investigation has been going on for some time past under the direction of His Honour Judge Prendergast, one of the county judges of the province of Manitoba. We have asked Judge Prendergast to complete his report as rapidly as possible, so that it may be laid before parliament. So soon as the report is in my hands, I will have it laid before parliament without any unnecessary delay. I can assure the hon. gentleman that everything that can be done by the department to protect the interests of bona fide buyers will be done. Of course, it would be altogether improper for me to express any opinion until the result of the investigation is known ; but I might say that the investigation so far indicates that the first reports regarding the irregularities were very much exaggerated.

1.	That the practice of delivering speeches of great length in the Canadian House of Commons has introduced a discursive and irrelevant style of discussion, is destructive of pertinent debate upon public questions, leads to waste of valuable time, unreasonably increases the length of the sessions of parliament, is in marked contrast to the practice with regard to debate that prevails in the British House of Commons, and tends to repel the people of Canada from a careful and intelligent consideration of the proceedings of parliament.
2.	That it is desirable that rules and modes of procedure be adopted limiting, under certain conditions, the length of speeches, and regulating the general conduct of debate in that regard.
3.	That a speciaLcommittee be formed to. consider the question"" of parliamentary debate, length of speeches, general conduct of debate,
and proper methods of securing greater promptitude in the despatch of the business of the Canadian House of Commons, so far as they be consistent with parliamentary rights and the general interest of the public; and report its recommendations to this House.
4.	That such special committee shall be composed of the following members : Messieurs Britton, Cowan, Haggart, Clarke, Parmalee, Monk, Madore, Fortin, Russell, Costigan, Tup-per, LaRiviere, Oliver, Prior and the mover.
He said : The motion which I am about to make, Mr. Speaker, was brought under the consideration of the House two sessions ago, and upon that occasion received unfavourable action. It was upon the Order paper last session, but owing to the delays, which this motion aims at, instituting proceedings to prevent, it was never reached.
I am glad to have this opportunity, at this early stage of the session, of bringing the matter to the attention of the House again. The feeling, I think, in the House itself, is a pretty general one that some modification of our rules might possibly be made in order to facilitate the despatch of business, and correct some of the evils that have been gradually growing up in the procedure of parliament. The tendency to lengthy speeches has been a growing one, for several sessions past, and the length of the speeches has tended to tljp prolongation ot debates often extending over days and weeks, consuming an enormous amount of time, and with practical results of very little consequence indeed.
The country, so far as my observation goes, looks upon the mode of conducting business in the House of Commons with a good deal of disfavour and dissatisfaction, and the methods which we have drifted into are of a character to repel the country from a proper consideration of the proceedings of parliament. We are gradually reaching a position when the proceedings of the House attract very little public attention, compared to their importance, owing to the prolongation of debates by speeches marked by their irrelevance and want of logical application to the case.
This resolution proposes no specific rules. It merely recites the facts with regard to the operations of this House and the methods we are falling into in the conduct of business. It proposes no line of conduct for the remedying of this evil except the indirect one, which, I trust, will bear direct and positive fruit, namely, the appointing of a committee to examine fully into the case, to take into careful consideration all the facts connected with our procedure, and the results which have flown from the application of these rules, and to consider whether it may not be practical, to some extent, to adopt a modification of these rules which will lead to a more rapid despatch of business and lessening the length of parliament and improve the conduct of business in such a way as will commend the approval of the government and the House,

and bring about a more practical method of transacting the affairs of the country.
The United States House of Representatives many years ago were driven, by long discursive speeches and waste of time, to the adoption of rules for the purpose of saving time. Some of these rules we shall have before us if a committee is given for our guidance, as well as the rules and regulations of the English House of Commons. In the United States House of Representatives, for instance, speeches are limited to one hour, a time is fixed for the closing of debate, and after a certain stage of debate speeches are limited to five minutes. Several speakers may, of course, give up their time to one, but all the time that each speaker is entitled to is five minutes. Any amendment made to an original motion, which, in our case, opens the whole field of discussion again, can only be presented in a speech of fifteen minutes, and must be replied to in a speech of ten minutes, and the debate upon it is then closed. It was found imperatively necessary to adopt rules of this character in order to get the busiuess of the country through within a reasonable time. We are reaching the same position which existed in the United States when these rules were adopted. We had a session of six months last year, during which we had thirty-three motions to adjourn, which led to a practical waste of thirty-three days, and an expenditure of that time on questions which did not appear on the Order paper. In the meantime hon. members had to wait from day to day, and from week to week, and from month to month, to reach motions they had on the Order paper. That was the ease with myself, and even then I did not reach the motion I had on the paper for final action at all. Without enlarging further on the question, I may say that we are all aware that much valuable time is thus wasted, and that it is desirable to adopt rules for the securing of greater pertinence and brevity in the character of the speeches, and greater speed in the despatch of business.
The committee, if granted, will have this question under its consideration, and will make what suggestions or recommendations to this House it may think fit. These can be dealt with by the House, and the House is not committed, by the granting of this motion, to anything the committee may recommend. Unless this House adopts any recommendation of the committee, of course, there will be no change, but I think, considering the circumstances, considering the methods we have fallen into in the discharge of our duties, it would be wise to adopt a committee to consider what should be done, and then leave the matter in the hands of the House.

casion for presenting this motion at the present time. It is true that the methods of debate in any deliberative assembly must always demand attention. It is possible that, sometimes, time is wasted in this House. I suppose that the same can be said of any deliberative body. Until we become perfect, it is absolutely impossible to conduct the business without wasting more or less time. But the move which the hon. gentleman (Mr. Charlton) proposes is one of a great deal of importance, and I expected to have heard a word from the right hon. gentleman who leads the House in regard to it. It is a matter that does not affect solely this parliament, or this session; it is a matter that will be of very serious moment to future parliaments. There are two things that must be borne in mind in dealing with it-in the first place, to secure the transaction of public business without waste of time, and in the second place, to secure to every man in the House of Commons as great liberty in discussion and criticism as is consistent with the transaction of public business in a legitimate way.

If there is to be a change, the hon. gentleman (Mr. Charlton) has not given us any light as to the particular methods which will be suggested to the committee which he moved. I think that this is a matter in which we shall do well to ' hasten slowly.' We should not take it upon ourselves within a few days of the opeuing of this first session of a new parliament, to deal with a matter of this kind, which, possibly, in the opinion of a great many members of the House is not a matter that very urgently requires to be dealt with at all.

In fact, if I remember aright, this is the third time that my hon. friend has brought this identical motion to the attention of the House. On previous occasions I did not for my part favour the passing of such a motion; and I see no reason to modify the views I formerly entertained. I agree with my hon. friend that in the last parliament the speeches we listened to, were, perhaps, of a somewhat inordinate length. At that time, I said that I would rely upon the good sense of the House to remedy that evil without taking any formal step to do so. I have reason to believe that this parliament will see, in these matters, a very marked improvement. I suppose that this year, parliament will com? back to the old practice of delivering speeches of moderate length, and that there

will be no necessity to apply the American system to our procedure. My hon. friend says, very truly, that the practice lately introduced in this House, is in marked contrast to the practice of debate that prevails in the British House of Commons.

Still, I cannot see that there is any reason, at this early period of the session, for trying to correct what was, no doubt, an evil. 1 think we can try this parliament and see how far the evil, which was so marked in last parliament, will prevail in this one. But, I may say to my hon. friend, that it is not out of place for parliament to revise its rules generally. For my part, I am prepared, and, indeed, I intend to see if the rules of the House cannot be modified somewhat. I am a strong believer in the British system of procedure, and 1 would only suggest that we should see how far we can adopt the rules which prevail in England. If I say, that, at an early date,
I intend to call the attention of the House to this subject, perhaps my hon. friend will agree in the meantime, to withdraw his motion.
