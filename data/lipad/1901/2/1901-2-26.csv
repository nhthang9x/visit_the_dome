This is the commencement in a new parliament of an evil which always results in lengthening our sessions. The time for presenting petitions for private Bills and for the introduction of private Bills cannot be unknown to the public, and they ought to be ready with their Bills at the proper time. I think that the beginning of a new parliament is the proper time for us to put our foot down on a custom which has obtained very largely of late, and which is a very inconvenient one for us. I think that if it were given out early in the session, and in this parliament, that these extensions would not be made as easily as they have been heretofore, the people would govern themselves accordingly, and this would assist Mr. HUGHES (Victoria).

to regulate freight and passenger rates on railways. He said : I may say, in briefly explaining this Bill, that it is the same Bill that I introduced last session, and also the session previous. It is for the purpose of appointing a commission to regulate freight and passenger rates on railways. The Bill provides that the railway commission shall have power, in case of any difficulty arising between railway companies and shippers, to settle those matters. When the second reading comes up I shall go into the matter more fully. I hone that at this session the Minister of Railways and Canals (Hon. Mr. Blair) will kindly give this matter his consideration, and help me to pass it. I believe there is a general desire through the country for the appointment of a railway commission of some kind. This Bill may

not be perfect, but if we pass it now we will have an opportunity before next session of seeing exactly what is required, and any defects in it may then be remedied. In preparing this Bill I have taken the Interstate Commerce Act as a guide. On the other side of the line, I understand, that Act is doing a great deal of good, it makes the rates uniform and protects the shippers to a great extent. I hope that my Bill will have the support of the House, and that 1 shall be able to get it through this session.

1844,ca.proc.d.1901-02-26.4.1.1,1901-02-26,,,,stagedirection,,,,"The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR (Hon. Clifford Sifton) moved for leave to introduce Bill (No. 29) to amend tne Dominion Lands Act. He said : I may say in explanation of this Bill, that its various clauses relates more or less to matters of detail in the administration of Dominion lands. The first clause needs no explanation. The second clause is for the purpose of enabling another officer to sign official documents in place of the commissioner of Dominion lands in his absence. The third clause relates to the date at which the settler is required to perfect his homestead entries by going upon the land. It provides that the entry may be declared void at the end of six months in the discretion of the minister of the department. At the present time, and for some years past, that has been the actual practice, and my attention was called to the fact that the practice has not been in accordance with the statute, and I propose to ask the House to amend the statute so as to make it accord with what has been the practice. Strictly to follow the statute at present might work a great injustice, because sometimes settlers are not able to go upon the land within the exact period of six months. The fourth clause enables the settler Who comes from the United States to have one year from the time he is making his entry to perfect it. It is found that is necessary in the case of people who come from the western states, who sometimes, after selecting their land, are not able to come back as soon as they intended. Under this clause he may have one year to perfect his entry. The fifth clause relates to an amendment made a year or two ago with respect to the homestead law under which a settler was enabled to perform his residence upon the second homestead by living upon his first homestead. It was the intention that that clause should apply only in cases where homesteads were taken up in the vicinity of the first homestead. But the settlers display considerable ingenuity in interpreting the law, and some have attempted to make it apply where the homesteads were in different parts of the countrv 14}
altogether. The amendment adds these words : ' If the second homestead is in the vicinity of the first homestead.' The sixth clause is for the purpose of removing a provision which was contained in an amendment made at the instance of the then member for Western Assiniboia, Mr. Davin, some three years ago, to enable the homesteader to get his patent for a second homestead by having a certain number of cattle instead of doing cultivation duties. The provision requiring that he shall cultivate at least one acre of land has also been found to be of no practical benefit, and we propose to remove it. The seventh section is for the purpose of removing a clerical error that existed in the amendment made a couple of years ago. The eighth section is for the purpose of removing a doubt ir. regard to the construction of a clause in the Dominion Lands Act, relating to assignments which settlers might make before they were entitled to their patent. The law does not permit a settler to make an assignment before he is entitled to his patent, but it was found in operation to be very hard, because a settler might make an assignment without knowing the provisions of the law and without intending to violate them. Two or three different provisions were made in regard to this particular subject. This clause is for the purpose of making clear the effect of the last amendment. I will go into it more fully when the Bill is before the Committee and when the legal effect of the amendment may be explained.
The 9th clause is for the purpose of enabling the Department of the Interior to issue a patent to a settler or a company who may have made an advance to a settler under the provisions of the Act which was passed a number of years ago, providing that companies might make advances to settlers upon the security of their homesteads. There have been cases in which settlers have got advances, have complied with the requirements of the law as to residence and cultivation of the soil and have left the country without getting their patents, thinking perhaps that the land was not worth any more than the advance upon it. In such cases it is quite clear that the companies are entitled to the patent for the- land so as to realize the security which was provided for under the original Act. A technical difficulty has arisen in this case by reason of the fact that some of these settlers were not British subjects and consequently the department could not issue the patents. The purpose of the amendment is to enable the department to issue a patent when the settler is not a British subject and has not taken out his naturalization papers.
The 10th clause is to enable the Department of the Interior to issue grazing leases under regulations made by the Governor in Council without each individual lease coming before council. It has been found to be extremely troublesome and to cumber",,,,
1845,ca.proc.d.1901-02-26.4.1.2,1901-02-26,,,,stagedirection,,,,"the work of council very much, when the requirement of the law is that there should he an order in council for each lease.
The 11th clause is for the purpose of avoiding the necessity of leases of public lands issued by the Department of the Interior being under the Great Seal of the Crown. The Deputy Minister of Justice has lately advised the department that this amendment ought to be made.
Clause 12 is for the purpose of providing that in all cases where interest is accruing upon the sales of Dominion lands the rate of interest from July 7, 1900, when the Act which was passed last session relating to the rate of interest, shall be 5 per cent instead of 0 per cent, as it was before.",,,,

He said : Mr. Speaker, I shall take the liberty of following the example set by my hon. friend the Minister of the Interior (Mr. Sifton), and acting in accordance with a very wholesome practice in the British House of Commons where it is customary to explain the character and nature of Bills

upon their introduction, to offer a few remarks upon the measure that I propose to submit to the House. The Bill which I shall have the honour to place in your hands, Mr. Speaker, provides for certain amendments to the Dominion Lands Act. It provides that subclauses 2, 3, and 4 of clause 29 of the Dominion Lands #ct, chap. 54, R.S.C., be repealed, and the following clauses substituted therefor :
Subclause 2. The sale of the public lands of the Dominion suitable for agricultural purposes shall be to actual settlers only upon reasonable terms of settlement and in such areas as can be reasonably occupied and cultivated by the settler.
Subclause 3. No grants of public lands of the Dominion shall in future be made to railway or other corporations.
Subclause 4. Subelause 5 of class 29 aforesaid is hereby amended by substituting the word ' may ' for the word ' shall ' wherever the same occurs in the third line of the said sub-clause.
The provision of this Bill as embodied in the hist subclause with reference to the reservation of the agricultural lands of this Dominion for actual settlers only, is a provision which was adopted by the opposition in the House of Commons in the year 1879, and it formed a portion of the policy which they presented to this country from that time on. It is a provision which was embodied in the platform, adopted by the great Liberal convention which met in this city in June, 1893. It is a provision which I believe, Mr. Speaker, has been practically adhered to and honoured in the observance by the government during the past five years. Still, I think it well that this provision should be placed in explicit terms upon the statute-book, and should not be left as a provision to be carried into effect by departmental regulations, and by the action of the government in a sense, where that action may under certain circumstances be made to vary from the principle laid down. It is unnecessary for me at any length to enlarge upon the .iustice of this provision, or to enlarge upon the necessity in the public's interest for endorsing and preserving this principle. The future greatness of this country will depend upon the settlement and the cultivation of its public lands, and any measure or policy which is calculated to lessen the hardships that beset the pioneers in their struggles against the difficulties incident to the task that they undertake in a new country, is a policy which should meet with the approbation of every citizen of Canada. The more rapidly these public lands can be settled and the more favourable the conditions under which the toiler settles these lands, the greater is the benefit that Canada will derive from the extension of civilization and the bringing under cultivation of these waste areas. It is an outrageous thing. Sir, to allow the middleman to step in between the settler and the government, and purchase large areas of land
to be doled out by him afterwards to the settler at three times or four times or mayhap five times the price which the government received from him for these lands. The interests of the country are in no sense benefited by such a transaction. The settler is injured; the government receive no greater advantage than would have accrued had it reserved the land for sale direct to the settler, except, possibly a small item of interest upon the sum it received from the speculator in anticipation of the time when it would sell these lands to the actual settler. For reasons, which I might enlarge upon to a great extent, the policy which 1 propose is one which ought to commend itself to the favourable judgment of every member of this House. It is a policy which the government lias practically recognized, and it is a policy which should be placed upon the statute-book as a mandate to this government, and to all future governments in reference to the management of our public domain.
With regard to the second subclause of this Bill, which provides that in future no land grants, whether of agricultural lands or otherwise, shall be made to any railway or any other corporation; I think it is high time that this matter should receive the careful and candid consideration of this House. 1 have it upon the authority of the Minister of the Interior, that we have at this moment (>7,000,000 acres of land locked up in the North-west. Not all of these acres are lands that the railway company will acquire but all of this-an empire in itself-is withheld from settlement till the railway corporations deign to inform us what portion of these lands they will take for their grants. These lands can not be settled; these lands must lie waste; not only are they not susceptible to settlement, but the condition prevailing, that these lands intervene between the railways and the public lands of the Dominion, that are available for settlement, is a condition which is in the highest degree detrimental to the interests of the country. These lands cannot be taxed, and where in some cases these lands are located by railway companies, the settlers are scattered here and there upon alternate sections struggling with the difficulty of having one-tliird or perhaps one-half the land of a township that can be cultivated, taxed or settled upon, and this one-third or one-half the area of the township must bear the expense of making roads for the whole township, the expense of establishing school sections, and all the expenses incident to civilization in this far western country.
It always causes me a pang to think of our fatuity in the past in granting such enormous areas so recklessly as we have done. Sixty-seven millions acres tied up now. to say nothing of the lands that have been appropriated by the railways. And what are 67.000,000 acres ? Why 67,000,000 acres is an area large enough for two or",,,,

It is time to change our policy. We gave in 1881, 25,000,000 acres of land to one corporation. We gave to that corporation $25,000,000 in money. We gave to that corporation certain sections of the Canadian Pacific Kailway constructed by ourselves, and which cost us $30,000,000. We loaned to that corporation $20,000,000. We took back from the corporation at $1.50 an acre, lands for $10,000,000 of this money. We paid for the Canadian Pacific Railway. We paid every dollar that it cost, and if we had built this road as government property we would have had it to-day without expending one dollar more than we have expended, and we would have had all the lands that have been granted to boot. Now, I do not make any attack upon the Canadian Pacific Railway. They coped with gigantic difficulties. That enterprise was put through with brilliant success and energy, and it has been a great work to keep that road open. It was an important national undertaking. It produced important national fruits. We might possibly have built that road and lost a good deal of money in running it. We might have demonstrated our incapacity to run the road as well as this private corporation has done; but, whatever may be said upon this question on one side or the other, I hold that the time has now come when this system of recklessly giving away the public domain of Canada to railway promoters with the intention of developing the country that we give away, is a policy which we had better cease to pursue. The policy of the United States in this respect might furnish us with a wholesome lesson. The same spirit of recklessness prevailed in that country when they had an enormous public domain. They did not realize that this land would be wanted in the near future by the settler. They failed to realize the greatness of the heritage they had in their possession. They failed to recognize the importance of husbanding these resources, and dealing with this vast public domain in a common sense and proper manner, and it was given to railway promoters- given in millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of acres ; and one day the United States government woke up to find that they had practically no public land left- that the whole of the public domain was in the hands of corporations ; and these corporations have gone on rolling up their wealth, until now we have a syndicate owning nearly all the railways of the United States and the United States government has, by its land policy, contributed to the result which the whole country deplores today. We do not want to follow their example. We want to realize before it is too late, that the entire policy of making land grants to railways, was an ill-conceived and",,,,

For these reasons I think the time has come when this parliament should, by legislation, affirm the principle that land grants of this character are not in the public interest, and shall not hereafter be made.

FRASER (Guysborough).,,DOMINION LANDS ACT AMENDMENT.,,,"I beg leave to support this Bill with all my heart. I believe, as the hon. member for North Norfolk has said, that the land of this country belongs to the country for the people who till it ; and if that fundamental principle is kept in view, our country will increase as it never has done before. I will go further than the hon. member. Not only would I prohibit the giving of any land to large corporations, and give it only to those who would become bona fide settlers upon it, but I would to-morrow find some means of estimating the value every acre of land that belongs to the Canadian Pacific and every other corporation, and I would pay them what they are entitled to for their land, and throw it open to actual settlers. We never can succeed in a country like the North-west except by the settlers settling down as near one another as possible, and under the most favourable conditions. Indeed, there are those who think that it might perhaps be a good investment for the government to make it still easier for the settlers by building small houses for them, and in the meantime holding the land as security. I will not go that far, for I think that any man who gets 160 acres of land in that country under the conditions now prevailing will have no difficulty, if he is a diligent and careful man, in making a better living there than he could in the older provinces. But 1 would not hamper him at all. I would give him the opportunity of getting the land. I would open every district in the country, making it as free as it was before we obtained possession of it, to every good man who wanted to go in and settle there. That country will never become as great as it was destined to be until these restrictions are removed. It is right in principle, and what is right in principle will always work out in practice. This is not the first time that I have declared in this House most emphatically, and I will continue to declare, that any government of this country would do a wise thing for the country if they could again obtain possession of the lands which we have given to various corporations, and throw them open to the people. The effect of this Bill will be that the land will only be given to bona fide settlers. That will have a double effect. In the first place, settlers knowing that they can get land there, and that it will not be tied up, will be more ready to go into that country ; and in the next place,

the alternate sections not being held by the corporations, the settlers will come nearer to one another. Their roads, their school-houses, and all their material interests, are bound up in this question. I support this Bill, and trust that it will receive the sanction of this parliament.

I do not understand the position they take, in view of the statement which I understood the Alin-ister of the Interior (Hon. Air. Sifton) to make last session, that all the lands which it was possible to give to railways, had been granted already. He has not any lands to give, and therefore the Bill is of no use.

A sudden change has come over the spirits of the hon. member for North Norfolk and the hon. member for Guysborough. But a short time ago we had introduced into this House the celebrated Yukon Railway Bill, the object of which was to give a large grant of land to a railway company, and, if I remember rightly, both the hon. member for North Norfolk and the hon. member for Guysborough supported that Bill. I congratulate both of these gentlemen on their change of view ; but the practical application of this Bill is all nonsense. The lands that have been granted for railroads in fact cover all tlie lands that are at the disposal of the government. They have no more land to give to railroad companies, and to introduce a Bill to stop the giving of lands when they have none to dispose of, is a perfect absurdity. As to the rest of the lands, the conditions which the hon. member for North Norfolk wishes to impose by the Bill, are already imposed by the Dominion Lands Act, namely, that they are to be given to actual settlers only.

The statement I made to the House last session,' or the session before, was with regard to the ability of the government to satisfy the demands of a railway company under its contract; and the statement I made was that the government had not been in a position to
offer those gentlemen from the odd-numbered sections such lands as they were willing to accept. The statement was not quite so unreserved a one as my hon. friend has said.

MACLEAN (East York).,,DOMINION LANDS ACT AMENDMENT.,,,"I would like to point out for the information of hon. gentlemen opposite, that the way to get all these lands back, is to go in for the scheme of government ownership of railways, which I proposed the other day. That was one of my main reasons, which I forgot in the heat of my argument. I pointed out that we could secure the Canadian Pacific Railway by lease, but I forgot to point out that if we leased that road, we would get back every acre of its land grant. True, I believe the land is pledged for the bonds of the road ; but the land would come into the hands of the government again, and we would have it for the people ; and I believe there is enough land owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to-day, if taken back into the hands of the government, and used to the best advantage, to pay every bond and every other indebtedness of the Canadian Pacific Railway. If these gentlemen wish to have the land returned to the people, and settled under the best auspices, there is the way to do it : nationalize the railways, get the land back, and use that land to bring settlers into Canada.

I rise rather for the purpose of calling attention to the statement which my hon. friend made, who. introduced the Bill, and which seems to imply an erroneous idea, and one which I think it would be well to correct. Aly hon. friend stated that he thought the time had now arrived when we should reverse our policy of giving settlement lands to railways in the form of subsidies or land grants. I take exception to the implication, because I submit that that time has already arrived and that we reserved that policy some years ago. This government reversed that policy, and resolved that it would not give any settlement lands by way of subsidy to any railway, and have adhered to that resolution.

I am not now speaking of mineral lands, for I think there could be no possible objection at any time to giving mineral lands, if thereby we insure the prospecting of mines and the development of the country as well as the construction of railways. But there is a clear and manifest distinction in the mind of

any one who considers the subject, between grants of mineral and grants of settlement lands, and that distinction the government has drawn and adheres to. No legislation therefore is' necessary, so far as this government is concerned, in order that the policy we have adopted of not giving settlement lands as railway subsidies shall be adhered to.
At the same time I have not suggested any objection to the Bill itself. I do not know precisely what the Bill is, and when it comes to be closely examined in its details, it may be found desirable to modify it.

Most Gracious Majesty,-
Tour Majesty's most faithful and loyal subjects, the Commons of Canada, in parliament assembled, beg leave most humbly to represent :
That as a token of the civil and religious liberties and of the quality of rights guaranteed to all British subjects in the Canadian confederation as well as under the British constitution, the British sovereign should not be called to make any declaration offensive to the religious belief of any subject of the British Crown.
That by virtue of the Act of Settlement of 1689 the British sovereign, on the first day of the meeting of the first parliament, or at the coronation, is called upon to make the following declaration
' I, A. B., by the grace of God, King (or Queen) of Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, do solemnly and sincerely, in the presence of God, profess, testify and declare that I do believe that in the sacrament of the Lord's Supper there is not any transubstantiation of the elements of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, at or after the consecration thereof by any pergon whatsoever ; and that

the invocation of adoration of the Virgin Mary or any other saint, and the sacrifice of the Mass, as they are now used in the Church of Rome, are superstitious and idolatrous. And I do solemnly, in the presence of God, profess, testify and declare that I do make this declaration, and each and every part thereof, in the plain and ordinary sense of the words read unto me, as they are commonly understood by English Protestants, without any evasion, equivocation or mental reservation whatsoever, and without any dispensation already granted me for this purpose by the Pope or any other authority or person whatsoever, or without any hope of any such dispensation from any person or authority whatsoever, or without thinking that I am or can be acquitted before God or man, or absolved of this declaration or any part thereof, although the Pope or any person or persons, or power whatsoever, should dispense with or annul the same or declare that it was null and void from the beginning.'
That such declaration is most offensive to the dearest convictions of all Roman Catholics.
That the staunch loyalty of His Majesty's Roman Catholic subjects in Canada, comprising about 43 per cent of the entix'e population of this Dominion, and throughout British possessions, should not be rewarded by their being chosen alone amongst believers of all creeds and branded as adolatgrs by their sovereign.
That in the opinion of this House, the above-mentioned Act of Settlement should be amended by abolishing the said declaration, and the British sovereign freed for ever from the obligation of offending the religious principles of any class of his faithful subjects throughout the British Empire.
That is the motion I intend to move as an amendment on going into Supply, on the first occasion I have the opportunity of doing so.

Before you leave the Chair, Mr. Speaker, I wish to draw the attention of the House, and especially of the government, to a matter that I think of considerable moment to Canada, particularly to the Pacific coast. I see In the newspapers an account of the proposed visit of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, and it is as follows :-
In connection with the proposed visit to the colonies of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York, the London Times states that it has been decided to commission the Ophir this month, and that their Royal Highnesses will leave England in March. The cruise, which will extend to Canada, will probably occupy about six months; and, according to present arrangements, the following places will be visited :	Gibraltar, Malta, Colombo,
Singapore, all the Australian colonies and two ports in New Zealand, one in each island. The homeward voyage will probably include Mauritius, the Cape, and possibly one of the West Indian Islands, as well as a Canadian port.
With regard to the escort, two cruisers of the Channel squadron will accompany the Ophir to Gibraltar

-and so ou. From that account and from all the accounts in the newspapers that I have seen, it seems that their Royal Highnesses are not to visit the Pacific coast, and, if they come to Canada, as we trust they will, they will come to Halifax, aud probably then come inland a little way, perhaps to Montreal and Toronto, but not further west. I think hon. gentlemen will agree with me that, if such is the case, it will he a thousand pities for the good of all concerned. When our present King was here as Prince of Wales in 1860, he did not go any further west than Toronto.

But, see the change that has taken place in the last few years. These provinces and territories are now populated by thousands and thousands of loyal and staunch people, who would give anything to have the same chance of seeing their Royal Highnesses as the people of eastern Canada will have. In the first place, it would strengthen the ties that already so strongly bind the colonies to the mother land, and it would also show our future King and Queen the immense value and immense area of this great country and also the affectionate regard in which they are held by the people. Not only that, Sir, but, coming down to a less important matter, though one of great importance to us, it would draw the attention of the whole world to the great possibilities of this country of ours. We all know that every movement of such distinguished people as the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York are heralded by the press and brought to the notice of the whole world. Nothing that could take place, I think, would bring Canada more to the attention of the world than a trip of these distinguished visitors from one side of the continent to the other. I, therefore, thought it was my duty, as representative of the Pacific coast, to bring this matter forward, and to impress upon the government what I consider the necessity of their doing their best to cause this route, which has already been mapped out, to be altered to some extent, if possible, and to bring about such a change as will allow their Royal Highnesses to come to the Pacific coast, and from there, travel across the continent and take ship on the Atlantic.

The most convenient, and, I believe, the best mode of all, would be for their Royal Highnesses, who are to return from Australia next September, to come by way of the Pacific instead of the Atlantic, landing at Vancouver, visiting British Columbia, the Territories, Manitoba, and so on, down towards Halifax.

SPROULE.,,SUPPLY-THE CORONATION OATH.,VISIT OF THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CORNWALL AND YORK.,,"I am glad the hon. the Postmaster General has given us this information, because I remember not very long ago a speech made by that hon. gentleman in our part of the country. I want to read the Committee a report of his speech that appeared in his own paper, the ' great speech of the Postmaster General at Aleaford,' in support of his friend Mr. C. W. Hartman, whom he was bound to elect. He went on to decry what had been done by his predecessor, and said with regard to his own conduct of the Post Office Department :
Hon. Wm. Muloek stated that he had praeti-cially wiped out a deficit of $780,000, and left a million dollars in the pockets of the people.
I denied that statement at my nomination. It was made in my presence by his candidate, Air. Hartman, and I had with me then the Public Accounts and gave them as my authority. In answer to that, my opponent said: But, these Public Accounts are a year old, and I am authorized to say that that deficit is wiped out. Now, I have the hon. gentleman's report for the last year in my hand, and what does it say :
The deficit on June 30, 1899, was $398,917.
Just as I gave it to that audience then, and my hon. friend the Postmaster General misled that audience by telling them there was no such deficit. On the 30th of June, 1900, tlie deficit given in this same return is $461*-661, as the Postmaster General has given it now. Yet he had that information in his own department last November, but he told the people of Grey that he had wiped that all out, and he asked the people to vote for his candidate, because of the successful management of the Post Office Department by himself. Now, what does this Committee think of the twaddle dished up to an unsuspecting audience back in our country by the Postmaster General when he misleads them by such a statement ? I want this House to know it, and I want the country to know it, because I said then as I say now, that when that return comes down which I am perfectly satisfied that the deficit will be larger instead of smaller, and instead of being wiped out it will be at least $400,000 if not more. His own report verifies that

prediction, and it proves tlie correctness of what I said, and the incorrectness of what the Postmaster General told the people of the east riding of Grey, when he was up there in the last campaign.

While there was last year a deficit of $46,000, that deficit may now he turned the other way, because the Postmaster General gave the assurance that before long the deficit would be wiped out in its entirety. That was the statement made by the premier himself on the authority and on the assurance of the Postmaster General. Now, the premier happened to be in the town of Stratford, and it is a noteworthy circumstance that wherever the premier went in the province of Ontario, devastation followed the Grit candidate. At Stratford, the premier told what the deficit was in 1890, and said that the Postmaster General had reduced that deficit to a nominal amount. And, mark you, at that time tlie premier must have been aware that there was a deficit of $401,000, because that speech was made subsequent to the 1st day of July. But, the premier was bound to go one better on that occasion, and lie said :
And he had the Postmaster General's authority for further saying that by the end of the present year the revenue and expenditure would balance one another.
Now, I think the premier is to be commiserated in this, that he went out on a public platform and made a statement oil the assurance of the Postmaster General that that deficit was wiped out in its entirety. Now, the premier is placed on one of the two horns of a dilemma: Either the Postmaster General made the statement to him or lie did not. If the Postmaster General made that statement to the premier,, he tried the confidence game on him; and, I say that here, and now is tlie proper time for the Postmaster General to apologize to the premier for having misled him into making that statement.

He told us a few minutes ago, when asked by members on this side of the House to give his statement of the present fiscal year so far as lie could, and he said : We do not keep any accounts, we do not balance till the end of the year. Well, Mr. Chairman, I hold in my hand a statement of accounts of the Post Office Department for the five months ending with the month of November, 1900, showing a comparison between November, of 1900, and November, 1899, and it is as follows :	In November, 1899, tlie department expended $260,000; in November, 1900, $309,000 or $49,000 more. That was furnished by the Post Office Department. For the five months ending November 30, 1899, tlie expenditure was $1,150,000; for the five months ending November 30, 1900, the expenditure was $1,279,237.50, or an increase in these five months of $129,237. Now, Mr. Chairman, I should like to ask the lion.

Perhaps, when I have made my observations, it will not appear that matters are so far astray as some lion, gentlemen would seem to prove and perhaps desire. On January 1, 1899, tlie government reduced the rate of postage in Canada from three to two cents, and a week before a reduction of the rate from Canada to the greater part of the empire from five to two cents took place. That necessarily for the moment caused a shrinkage in the revenue of the department. Some gentlemen estimated it at one figure and others at another. The late lion. Minister of Finance (Mr. Foster), speaking in 1895, if I remember correctly, estimated the loss at $700,000. That was in his budget speech. The late leader of the opposition (Sir Charles Tupper) subsequently, in addressing the public, estimated the loss of revenue at $1,000,000 a year. It is not necessary to ascertain, nor can it be definitely ascertained, what that loss will amount to. It is sufficient to know that if for the moment you reduce tlie revenue from the domestic letter rate of three cents to two cents you, for the moment, cut down the revenue by one-third, that you do very materially, for the moment. affect the revenue, and when, in the spring of 1898, I asked parliament to authorize us to reduce our rate from three to two cents, I stated that for the time being there would be a substantial shrinkage in our revenue and that for the moment I thought it would necessarily lead to a considerable deficit between revenue and expenditure. Without being bound then or even now as to what would be the time limit when the volume of revenue would attain its former position, I ventured the prophecy in parliament then that the revenue would recover its former volume in about three years. I said that until it recovered we must expect substantial deficits in the working of the department, but that month by month as the people came to appreciate the advantage of cheap postage and took greater advantage of the postal system, there would be a considerable growth of revenue, and in

time it would attain its former proportions. 1 am not liere to compare results, because the time has not yet come ; the time in which I ventured to say that the revenue would attain its former position has not yet been reached, but I would say that the reduction went into effect on January 1, 1899. It, therefore, only had six months' effect on the public accounts of the department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1899. For the fiscal year, during the last half of which the rate of postage was reduced, there was a deficit of $398,000, or we may say $400,000. Twice $400,000 would be $800,000. Of course, the whole of that deficit was not occasioned, I presume, though a large portion of it was, by the reduction in the rates. Now, the next fiscal year closing June 30 last found us with a deficit for the full year of $461,000. For that deficit the country had for one whole year enjoyed the advantage of the reduced rates which hon. gentlemen prophesied would mean a loss of revenue of as much as $700,000, while others said that it would mean a greater loss. If we had had during that year the higher rates that my predecessors enjoyed, or if we had had the same amount of business, there would have been a very considerable surplus, but, when we began the fiscal year on July 1, 1899, we had only six months in which to recover the revenue, and therefore, the fiscal year beginning on July 1,1899, began with a very largely reduced revenue because of the reduction in the rates, but, Sir, the loss of revenue in July was very much less than it was in the previous January. In January, the first month of 1899, when the country had the reduced rates, there was a large loss of revenue. If that loss had represented the rate of loss throughout the year it would have represented a great shrinkage in revenue for the year, and in that case it would have proved the assertion of the former leader of the opposition, that this change in the rate meant a loss of revenue amounting to the best part of a million dollars. As months went by, our revenue began to increase, and it has steadily increased from that time to this. There is one feature in connection with the revenue that surprised me. Though the revenue grew month by month with varying proportion, but generally growing as compared with the corresponding month of the previous year under higher rates, I assumed that the growth would continue uninterrupted. Our revenue in the month of August, I think, was $4,000 above what it had been in the former August under the higher rates. I did not anticipate any interruption in that steady growth of revenue beginning with a deficit in January, 1899, and that deficit being almost wiped out within a period of less than a year and nine months, but, I found, a short time ago, that there had been an interruption. Hon. gentlemen may draw their own conclusions ; I give Mr. MITLOCK.
them these statements and they may explain the cause. For the months of September and November, 1900, we lost revenue, as compared with the corresponding months of the preceding year. What is the cause of that ? My theory is that as during the fall of 1900, Canada, Great Britain and the United States were undergoing the struggle of a general election, the volume of our trade must have been affected by these disturbances, and so the extraordinary circumstances happened of a loss of revenue in the post office for September and November, 1900. There was a surplus in the month of October, but taking the three months together the revenue only represented a growth of some $13,000 per month, which was less than we enjoyed from the time we reduced the postage. My calculations have been disturbed to that extent, and to that extent only. What I sought to represent on the platform was, and what I state here is, that having practiced wise economy-not penury, but fair economy-in the administration of the department, this, witli the reduced postal rates and the general prosperity, and increased trade that Canada has enjoyed owing to the government of this country, have made their mark upon the post office revenue so that what 1 prophesied in 1888, has been fully realized, if the experience of the past month is to continue. When we point to a deficit for the year 1900, of $460,000, we must remember that the reduced postal rates had only been in force for six months. We began that fiscal year with a revenue suffering extremely from that cut, but each month it gradually recovered itself. Even if it recover'd its former position at the close of the year, that would still leave us a shortage which would be felt upon our accounts by reason of the loss of revenue for the preceding months. And so it has been a sort of a stern chase; the revenue seeking to overtake the former figure, and now I may say that for the month of January, 1901, that is, two years after we reduced our postage rates, the revenue is $29,000 greater for that month than it was for January two years ago under the higher rates.

I repeat that statement. Of course, the country is growing, and 1 would not wish to starve the service. It would be unwise to do so, and if we do not increase the service we might, on the present basis of revenue, let the department pay its own way. When an lion, gentleman gets up and produces the accounts which appear in the official Gazette month by month,
I would point out that they by no means represent the net results of the operation of the Post Office Department, or of any other department, up to that moment. There may be receipts and expenditures not fully accounted for, and it is only a month or two after the close of the fiscal year, when you have all the figures in that you can balance up the revenue and expenditure. I have not got the figures for the current year. The current year began in July last, with a loss of revenue as compared with the month of July, at the higher postal rate. We had not attained the volume of revenue we attained in the seven months of the year, and therefore, whilst the expenditure' goes on the same throughout the whole twelve months, we did not get the full benefit of the high revenue for the whole year.

This year we are now in, the deficit will be much less than it was last year, notwithstanding the fact that the public will have reaped whatever advantage there is in having to pay two cents only instead of three cents under a former administration. When we enter upon our next fiscal year ; unless we are compelled to incur large expenditures-and as I have said I would not wish to impair the usefulness of the department by unwise economy-I think that with the fiscal year beginning the 1st of July next, you will find but little difference between the revenue and the expenditure of the Post Office Department.

Mr. HAGGART.,,SUPPLY-THE CORONATION OATH.,VISIT OF THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CORNWALL AND YORK.,,"I am not mistaken at all. We threshed out the question again and again. I took the trouble of going to my old deputy, Colonel White, and getting a statement of all the facts from him, and he showed me conclusively that that was the reason. Why is it that the hon. gentleman shows a deficit of nearly $400,000 more for the year 1896 than for the preceding year ? I am so certain of the matter that there cannot be any doubt about it. The hon. gentleman has charged to the year all the accounts which he thinks ought to be paid before the 1st of July, although they did not come in until a couple of months afterwards, while we had been in the habit of charging them to the year in which they were paid. The consequence is that he cannot now balance his accounts on the 1st of July, but has to wait for two or three months after the expiration of the year to find out all the accounts which he

thinks ought to be charged to that year. It may he a better system of book-keeping, but I do not believe it is. I believe the proper system is to charge the accounts to the year in which they are paid. It is impossible to keep the accounts hanging over for three or four months for the purpose of making a balance. But the hon. gentleman, by an alteration in the system of book-keeping, which he introduced when he came into office, made the deficit appear far larger than it really was, in order to show-and the statement was made boldly from one end of the country to the other- not perhaps that the boons of the department were falsified, but that they were placed before the public in such a manner as to deceive them-that, in fact, he found that accounts amounting to $300,000 or $400,000, which ought to have been charged to the previous year, were left out altogether. As a consequence, he was able to show a very favourable statement foi the next year, because the amounts to be charged to that particular year would be only for nine months of the year, unless he waited for three or four months after the end of the year, in order to give a correct statement of the whole amount accruing to that year; and then, necessarily, the statement for the succeeding year would be a deceptive one. What I mean to say is that the department was managed under its predecessor as economically and as faithfully as it is under the hon. gentleman. The hon. gentleman may claim credit for a reduction of postage from a three-cent to a two-cent rate. That may be an advantage to the country, and the country may feel gratified at it. I am glad to hear his statement that he expects that at the end of the fiscal year that reduction will be found to involve no loss to the country, and that probably at the end of two years both ends will meet. I made the same recommendation to my colleagues when I was Postmaster General, but they thought the time had not arrived for a reduction to a two-cent rate. The hon. gentleman is perhaps right in saying that we could not continue to charge three cents when a letter could be carried from any part of the United States to any other part for two cents ; we had to adopt the same rate that they had. and if a deficit resulted. I believe the people would willingly make it up. But let the statement no longer be made in this House that in the last year of the Conservative government there was a deficit in the Post Office Department of $780,000. There was no such deficit. I see that the right hon. premier, in an address in Toronto, stated that the Postmaster General, by his able administration of the department, besides reducing the rate of postage from three cents to two cents, had so succeeded that there would likely be no deficit in that department, and he compared that condition of things with a deficit of $780,000

We might as well conduct the debate in a more proper and courteous manner. In the Finance Department a day is fixed when accounts are closed. After that date, if any items come in affecting the previous year's accounts, they will not be considered by the Finance Department in balancing the year's accounts. But any other department may, for the purpose of giving a more accurate statement, carry on its balancing of the year's operations so as to include these items which affect that year, but shall have come in after the date fixed by the Finance Department. I was trying to compare the services under this administration with those under former administrations. There was no Yukon under former administrations, and we are not concealing anything. I would refer the hon. gentleman to the Postmaster General's report oni page A-XI. Referring to the total financial operations for the year, it states :
The total net revenue of the Post Office from all sources except that from the Yukon and Atlin districts exceeded that of the previous year by $1,053.25, and the total gross revenue exceeded that of the previous year by $20,391.09. On the other hand, the expenditure of the department, omitting from the comparison the special expenses incurred in the Yukon and At-iin districts, exceeded that of the previous year by $63,797.33, the excess being distributed somewhat evenly over the larger items of Post Office expenditure. It appears therefore that a considerably larger volume of postal business, sufficient to nearly balance the loss arising during the first half of the year as compared with the corresponding period of the previous year from the reduction of the postage, was handled at an increased expense of slightly over one and a half per cent.

He took exception to my stating that there was concealment, hut 1 tell the hon. gentleman that no milder language could he used to properly mark the course taken by the hon. gentleman. In his statement he has excluded two items-the Item of revenue, $21,550, and expenditure $112.368-which would make an addition to the deficit of $90,818. How does he attempt to explain this ? He said that his department had one way of keeping the accounts, and the Finance Department another. But, Sir, the accounts correspond if you take in these items. Yet the hon. minister professes to give a true statement when he makes the deficit $90,000 less than it really is. But some hon. gentlemen opposite say that we had not the Yukon in former years, and therefore, to make a proper comparison, the Yukon should he left out. Well, if the hon. gentleman had said that there was a deficit of $461,000 in 1900, but that he had not included the Yukon service, which would have increased the deficit $90,000, that might he a frank statement, but he did not. Ana if his report went to the country without the public accounts, what inference would be drawn ? The only inference that could be drawn would be that there was simply a deficit of $461,000, instead of a deficit nearly $100,000 more.

What was it ? Why, the hon. gentleman took advantage of the Queen's .iubilee to issue jubilee stamps, and these the public purchased from patriotic motives. Largely actuated by the proper sentiment which prevails in matters of that kind, the public bought these stamps, ranging in value from a half cent up to large figures. But. there was also in the minds of the people the belief that these stamps had a value. The Postmaster General, however, refused to exchange these for other stamps :
and the result is that he has unloaded, practically-beyond a few that were used- nearly half a million dollars on the public, which they hold to-day, and which the Postmaster General will not redeem. That was an act of bad faith. The hon. gentleman stated, on a former occasion in this House, that these stamps were being used. Any one can use a flve-dollar stamp to carry a letter from one post office to another if he likes, but only in this manner will the stamps be redeemed. It is not greatly to the credit of the hon. gentleman (Hon. Mr. Mulock) to make the statement that there was a very large deficit under the former government. As was pointed out by tiie hon. member for South Lanark (Hon. Mr. Haggart), that was largely a mere myth, a mere matter of book-keeping. The Postmaster General would have us believe that he reduced that deficit by the economy and wisdom that characterized his management of the department. As a matter of fact, he did it by means which his friends cannot defend. I defy the hon. minister, for instance, to rise in his place and deny that he has been guilty of the act I charged him with a moment ago. With regard to the Yukon postal service, I would like to ask the hon. gentleman if the mounted police are now performing any service that is not included in the charges made here ?

It was charged that the First Minister (Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid Lau-rier) made statements which were not supported by the facts. He would not nave made those statements, relating as they did to the Post Office Department, without the authority of the Postmaster General. There lore, the Postmaster General cannot dismiss file matter with a wave of his hand, and the remark that he is not responsible for newspaper reports. He is responsible for the information he gives to the First Minister. Then, with regard to the statements made by the Postmaster General in East Grey. These statements were made, not only at Meaford, but at Thornbury, Sing-hampton and Feversham. After repeating these things at four different places, it will not do for the Postmaster General to tell us that he would not pay any attention to newspaper reports. He said that he had wiped out the deficit of $780,000, aud had left $1,000,000 in the pockets of the Canadian people. He tells us to-day that the deficit is $460,000. But the hon. member for Botliwell (Mr. Clancy) has proved that he should add to that $90,000, the receipts from the Yukon having been $21,000 and the expenditure $113,000. Why does he not place that where it belongs, among the expenditures of the Post Office Department V In 1898, he entered in his report an amount of $48.33 as the post office expenditure in the Yukon. Does not every member of this House know-does not every citizen know- that that is not a correct statement of the expenditure of the Post Office Department in carrying the mails into and out of the Yukon ? The department were simply utilizing the North-west mounted police for the service and not paying them. Therefore, the Postmaster General's statement is misleading and unfair to the people of Canada. It is an untrue statement to make, that the deficit for the past year was $461,000, when, including this $91,000 which ought to be included, it would amount to over $550,000. The hon. Postmaster General says that he does not propose to pay any attention to what was said in the campaign. Does the Postmaster General intend to say to the country : I am going to make speeches on the public platform, but before I begin I warn you not to place the slightest reliance on anything I may say. We are coming to a nice state of things when a minister of the Crown declares before the whole country that he will ignore utterly what he has said upon the public platform. Here is one thing that he said, as reported in a friendly newspaper
Mr. Mulock was pleased to say that many independent Conservatives of Grey county had thrown party to the winds, and had decided to vote in their country's idterests. This senti-Mr. MACLEAN.
ment was not condned to Grey county alone, but the independent vote of Canada was lining up with the Liberal party.
The province of Ontario, where the Postmaster General, the Minister of Customs (Hon. Mr. Paterson), and the other ministers from that province, did their fine work, in the last parliament gave hon. gentlemen opposite a majority of a round dozen. Today there are eighteen or twenty of a majority of independent stalwart members against them. Therefore, the prediction of the Postmaster General was not verified where he had any influence or did any work.

Mr. Mulock then put a poser by asking the electors if they endorsed Dr. Sproule on the present occasion.
Well, Sir, the poser was answered a few days later by the intelligent electors of East Grey, and they said just what the Postmaster General wants them to believe now, that they are not to believe anything said by the Postmaster General. He went on :
Dr. Sproule had never brought the advantages of Meaford before parliament.
Well, Mr. Chairman, I think if he had consulted the ' Hansard' he would not have been able to make that statement, because Dr. Sproule, in season and out of season, has not confined his efforts to the county of East Grey ; while he has brought the necessities of that county to the attention of the House, he has been one of the foremost men in parliament in advocating a broad and comprehensive policy that would develop every portion of this Dominion. He said furthermore :
He could build five harbours on the former postal deficit alone. Some time ago he (Hon. Mr. Mulock) asked the town council to send him a plan of the harbour.
How generous and considerate he was.
The request was complied with, but the council had asked too little.
What a generous man! Why does he not pay his officials what is due them ? Why does he not pay the letter carriers what, by law, they are entitled to receive, instead of going up to the electors of the county of East Grey and saying to them : You electors of Meaford, why, you are not asking half as much as I would like to give you. He said :

I want to make a great harbour of Meaford. It might do for the present, but would not answer for the future. The harbour would have to be large enough to accommodate the largest ships.
The Great Eastern must sail into the harbour of Meaford, Mr. Chairman ; Meaford must be made a harbour for every vessel, not only vessels on the lakes of 6,000 tons or 8,000 tons, but a harbour that will accommodate ships of the Atlantic, which will make Meaford their headquarters, according to this generous statement of the Postmaster General, a man who is squandering the public money with bribes, who is not fail-enough to give the employees of his own department what the law says they should have. Now we will have to have revised editions from the Postmaster General of the statements that he has made, and of the statements he has put in his report, which are misleading to the extent that he has laid aside that Yukon matter. The Yukon is a part of Canada, it has been opened up in recent years, there is no reason why Yukon expenditures for the post office work should not be treated like any other expenditure, and included in the expenditures of the department, and thereby increased by the amount stated by the member for Both well (Mr. Clancy).

The expenditure to July, 1899, was of course very extensive in a new and unsettled country, and the police did perform a very large amount, if not the whole, of the postal service, the carriage of mails, and so on. Not all the cost of that service was charged in the public accounts to the Post Office Department; that was charged to the maintenance of the police or the vote out of which they were paid.

That was proportionately a very small affair until the Yukon was developed, but, after that, and under the hon. gentleman's regime, it was a very considerable matter. There is no question about that, because we can see what ail enormous amount the police have cost. There is this singular coincidence about that, regardless as to whether one or both parties pursued that system of making a statement to this House as to what each service lias cost, that it does not appear in regard to other departments. For instance, if the Marine Department, or the Department of Public Works, rendered a service to the Customs Department in connection with their vessels and matters of that kind, we find these charges are made by one department against the other for the service showing what each particular charge was, and what each service cost the country. It is a matter of book-keeping, it all comes out of one purse, but the statement would not be accurate, unless the books were kept in that way. That system obtains between all the departments, I think, but not in the Post Office Department, and the hon. gentleman's boast, a large part of it, perhaps, justifiable today in regard to the buoyant condition of matters in connection witli the postal service which he has been able to make, would be materially affected if lie had disclosed the whole of the facts, and had not desired to exclude from the cost of the postal service a large amount that was paid out to the police which does not appear in the statement which he has made.

Would he not look in the column of figures which the hon. Postmaster General has given us in his own report, and which contains the following :
The following statement shows the deficit upon the department's operations for the year ended June 30, 1896, and the revenue, expenditure and deficit for each of the succeeding years.
Would he not be likely to look there for it ? If not, then it is certainly misleading the public, because this is the only place that it should be expected to be found. He takes up the report and finds by it that there was a deficit of $461,661, for the last financial year. Any one who contradicts that, is contradicting the blue-book, which is the

only official record we can look to for information. I take up tlie public accounts and find that tliey give some of tlie items of expenditure and revenue of the Post Office Department which is not in this list. The report shows that $112,368 are left out, being the expenditure of the Yukon district, and if you add that to the other you have a deficit, not of $461,661, but of $553,000. Yet the lion.

' He followed that up by saying that a minister of the Crown who would stand up on a platform and make that statement, if it was not correct, was unworthy of respect as a public man. But now the Postmaster General stands up here and tells us that in the month of July of that year the revenue was running behind, that it ran more behind in October and November, and yet it was in the month of November that he made this incorrect statement in East Grey. His friends then told us that if they had the report of the last financial year it would show that there was an increase in the revenue of the Post Office Department all the time, and a decrease in expenditure, and it would prove that the Post Office Department was self-sustaining. But now the Postmaster General tells the House that the revenue was decreasing at that very time. As a defence, he tells us that in the month of January of this present year, there is an increase in revenue, and that what he meant to convey to the people of Canada was that if lie took into account the present increase of revenue, he would be justified in asserting that the revenue and expenditure would balance in a short time. But does he not see that this increase in revenue took place two months after he made that misleading statement to the people of East Grey ? When he tells us to-day that he is not willing to stand by the statement he made solemnly on the platform, he makes an admission that I do not believe that any other member of his party would be guilty of. I am glad to know that the people of the country have been set right in this matter, because in future they will know just how much weight to attach to any statement made by the Postmaster General (Hon.

If any one were sufficiently familiar with the report and should carefully look through it, no doubt he might find out after some research, that the Yukon expenditure is not included, but on the page before me there is not the slightest qualification to show that this expenditure does not include the

whole of Canada. The Postmaster General (Hon. Mr. Mulock) explains that for the purpose of comparison, we should not include the Yukon, because the Yukon was not included in previous years. I would like to point out to the hon. gentleman that his brother Minister of Customs (Hon. Mr. Paterson) is a sinner, if the Postmaster General himself is right, because I notice that the customs revenue for two or three years past has included very large sums from the Yukon, and last year it included no less a sum from this source than $613,191.97. 1 desire to point out to the hon. gentleman (Hon. Mr. Mulock) that when the Minister of Customs is comparing one year with another he includes the Yukon, but when the Postmaster General goes on the platform to compare one fiscal year with another, he omits the Yukon. If the Postmaster General thinks it fair to leave out the Yukon with respect to the expenditure in his department, I trusi that he will see that his brother ministers will leave out the Yukon when they come to compare the revenue of one year with the revenue of another. The two things are exactly on the same basis, but in the one case the ministers do not charge the expenditures on the Yukon, while in the other they take good care to credit themselves with the revenue from that territory.

Over the signatures of the auditors in question, is the following :
The revenue of the Post Office Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, amounted to $3,957,798.51, which, deducted from the cost of maintenance, $4,985,327.53, leaves a deficit of $1,027,529.02. Heretofore it has not been the practice to treat the amount expended under the head of civil government as a charge against the department, and were such a practice adhered to the deficit of $1,027,529.02 would be reduced by $246,376.83, leaving the outside service shortage $781,152.19.
That audit is purely and simply for services rendered for the fiscal year ending the 30th June, 1896, and it does not include any disbursement for service prior to that year. That was all carefully eliminated by the auditors, and the sum given represents the gross cost of the service for the year, on the theory that you pay and charge each year for the service rendered in that year. If the old deficit, rolled up year after year, amounting to between $600,000 and $700,000, were to have been added, instead of the auditors reporting a deficit of $781,000, they would have reported a deficit of nearly twice that.

published accounts of the Post Office Department of revenue and expenditure, and I suppose it will be accepted as a final settlement of our dispute on this matter. In 1896 the gross revenue of the department was $4,005,890.77 ; net revenue, $2,964,014.13. The deductions from revenue were $1,041,876.54, and paid by check, $3,593,647. I would like to know what changes were made in the law when we went out-in July, 1896, if I remember rightly-leading to increased receipts in the department in 1897. The gross revenue in that year was $4,311,242 ; the net revenue was $3,202,938 ; the deductions from revenue amounted to $1,158,840 ; and the amount paid by check was $3,575,411. All the possible economies for which the hon. gentleman can take credit must be in the deductions from revenue. Of course, he did not alter the amount of the receipts of the post offices in the different cities, towns and villages. His reductions must solely be in the amounts paid by check. Was there any alteration in the law or in anything else for which he could take credit by which the revenue would be more buoyant ? If he takes credit for reductions in the payments for carrying mails, these reductions must be found in the gross payments made by check ; and the difference between that year and the preceding year was the difference between $3,7S9,000 and $3,575,000. His gross revenue for 1899 is $4,325,000 and his net revenue $3,182,000, or $400,000 less than that of the preceding year ; the deductions from revenue amount to $142,000, or only $16,000 less than those of the preceding year; and the amount paid on contracts, notwithstanding the deductions from revenue, is greater by $6,000 than that of the preceding year. The amount paid by check is $3,381,000. Now, we will take the year 1900. The gross revenue is $4,345,822 ; the net revenue is $3,183,984 ; the deductions from revenue are $1,161,000, or more by nearly $20,000 than those of the preceding year, although the rate was nearly the same ; and the amount paid by check was $3,645,646. These are the figures of the hon. gentleman's own report, and I would like him to explain to me where his economies are, and what his alterations in the management of his office have been to cause those economies. What are the reductions made between 1896 and 1897 7 The only possible reductions would be in the amounts paid to contractors for carrying the mails, and these, I will venture to say, could not have been more than $40,000 or $50,000. Therefore, we have this misleading statement put before the country, that by some act of the Postmaster

General since he came into office, a deficit of $780,000 was virtually turned into something that was not a deficit at all. The hon. gentleman admits now a deficit of nearly $500,000, which he says was caused by a reduction from the three-cent to the two-cent rate. Very likely that is so ; but there is a deficit of $500,000 ; and 'the hon. gentleman promises that three or four years from now the accounts will perhaps balance. I doubt that very much. If they do, it will be entirely owing to the prosperity of the country. It may be that the reduction in the rate of postage does not actually cause a reduction of revenue, as people may send more letters ; but the fact remains that in the payments made by the department, which is the true test of economical management, there is no such saving as the hon. gentleman states.

With reference to postal notes and money orders, I cannot say that we are considering at the present moment the subject of abolishing either one or the other, or amalgamating the two classes of service. They are very different in their character. The postal note is for the transmission of small sums not exceeding $5, and is somewhat in the nature of a check. The money order is a different thing altogether, the name of the payee not appearing on the face of it, and the order not being payable except to the person named in the advice note which is sent by the postmaster who issues the order to the postmaster on whom the order is made. Whether in time they can be united into *one document remains to be seen. In the United States, they are getting up an order
now that looks very much like a fusion of the postal note and the money order. A few months ago an officer of the United States postal department came to Canada and had an interview with our officers on the subject of a free interchange of money orders, and negotiations are now going on with the view of facilitating that 'business. They have sent to us a form of order, which looks to me very much like a fusion of the postal note and money order. They have no postal notes, and their money order differs very materially from ours ; and as ours has been in force in its present form so many years, I hesitate to make any material change by abolishing it and adopting instead something like the postal note or check payable to the person named in the face of the document itself.

The department is allowing the business of this country to be turned into wrong channels. Take those large departmental stores in Toronto, for which this department is carrying goods thousands of miles at utterly ridiculous rates.

I do not know whether it has been the case in other counties besides that which 1 have the honour to represent, but, in that county since the election of the 7th of November last, and just previous to the election, a great many changes in post offices were made. Many postmasters, who were very competent officials, and had been for many years discharging their duties with credit to themselves and benefit to the community have been dismissed, and without any charge as far as the public know, without any investigation, having taken place. From my place in the House, I have asked questions with respect to two of these officials, and have received the somewhat curt answer of the minister that it was done upon his own responsibility, and that these men were partisans. Not only have postmasters been dismissed in this manner, but post offices have been moved from one part of a community to another, greatly to the detriment of the service, and post offices have even been closed up. 1 presume, though I do not know for certain, that the Postmaster General has been guided in the past by the advice of the gentleman who represented the county that I have the honour now to represent. When it became my fortune, whether good or ill, to replace that gentleman in this House, it was greatly to his annoyance, and he has sought to wreak his spite, on these office holders throughout the county; and not only upon the office holders, but upon the people in the county where the post offices have been changed or closed up. I have in mind a small place in a country district, Donegal, a name familiar to many of the gentlemen of this House, situated in the parish of Waterford, another name that is familiar. The post office there inis been closed up entirely, and I understand that the government are going to open another post office in a neighbouring district where there is one already. As a matter of fact, this is a mountainous district and a high mountain intervenes between these two places. Therefore, the people of Donegal-and there are ten or twelve heads of families to be served by this office-will be obliged to go two or three miles, and to climb the mountain to reach the other office. That is a great hardship. It seems to me that post offices are not placed for the benefit or the advantage, or the interest of the friends of the party in Mr. WALLACE.
power, but that the Post Office Department is intended for the benefit of all Canadians irrespective of party. It seems small to gratify spite by taking it out of these poor people in the remote district. Life for them is hard at the best; give them what advantage you can. If they are to be deprived of postal accommodation, it is a very great hardship indeed. I trust, therefore, the minister will take the advice of his responsible officers, especially the post office inspector, who is directly charged with the direction of these matters and not the advice of irresponsible parties, even though they are supporters of the government.

I think the case which he has made-perhaps, I may be permitted to say, from very insufficient material- justifies one in assuming that, with a good case, he would make a most powerful argument. The hon. gentleman exclaims against l our having closed up Donegal post office, and says it was a great offence against the pub-I lie. Then he complains because we have opened a post office near it, and in a more convenient place. I cannot pretend to charge my mind with all the details of the removal or change of postmasters. If my hon. friend (Mr. Fowler) has any grievance or any particular case which he thinks ought to be explained, 1 shall only be too pleased if he will direct my attention to it in a way that will enable me to come with the exact information necessary to reply to him. With reference to Donegal. I cannot pretend to give from recollection the circumstances and the reasons connected with changes in postmastership or location of offices. But, I may say that if, for example, a post office happened to be located in a place unsuitable for the public, that would seem a sufficient ground for the change. That may have been the reason for the change in the case of Donegal. My hon. friend says that that closing involved hardship to a number of people. I suppose that the number of patrons of that office, to some extent at least, would be indicated by the revenue of the office. If that affords the Committee any information whatever, I may say that the returns for the fiscal year ending 30tli June, 1900, indicates a gross revenue from that office of $3, or somewhat less than a cent a day

Mr. HAGGART.,,SUPPLY-THE CORONATION OATH.,VISIT OF THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF CORNWALL AND YORK.,,"Referring to the subject we were discussing before the House rose, the deficit of 1895-6, I promised to look into the subject. I have done so, and I think I can make it so clear that the Postmaster General or the Prime Minister will not, after this, make the statement that there was a deficit of $780,000 in 1893-6. From the figures that appear, it must have struck the Postmaster General, if not some of his assistants or deputies, that such a deficit was abnormal. The hon. gentleman, to confirm his statement, read a report of two auditors, experts, who, he thought, proved his case. I am going to base my statement entirely upon tlieir report, and I can prove conclusively to any gentleman who listens to me, that his statement is most fallacious. I do not blame the Postmaster General, because he may have been deceived by the figures, but any officer of his department that furnished such figures to him, ought never after to retain the confidence of the Postmaster General. The report is signed by Mr. W. H. Cross and Mr. W. F. Munro, the two auditors, and this is the conclusion of their report :
At the beginning of the fiscal year 1895-6, as the result of the deficits of previous years, there were outstanding liabilities of the department in the shape of unpaid accounts to the amount of $616,712.99.
That is not for the year 1895-6, but for the previous years.
At the close of the fiscal year 1895-6, the liabilities of the department in excess of all parliamentary appropriations applicable thereto amounted to the sum of $685,447.63. Thus the liabilities had increased during the year 1895-6 to the extent of $68,734.04.
Instead of the deficit of that year being $685,447.03, if he will look at the report of his auditors, he will see the deficit that year was only $0S,734.04.
The actual cost of the maintenance of the department in all its branches for the year 1895-6 was $4,985,327.53. The revenue of the Post Office Department for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, amounted to the sum of $3,957,798.51, which, deducted from the above-named gross cost of maintenance, namely, $4,985,327, leaves a deficit of $1,027,529.
From which has to be deducted, as the auditors put it correctly, the amount which has never been charged to the expenditure of the post office, the amount expended on civil government at headquarters in Ottawa. If the amounts that I had mentioned before dinner as overlapping, had been deducted, that deficit, instead of bein' $780,000, would be over $1,000,000. It is a'| amount which he deducts from his returns, and which was not deducted in the post office returns.
Heretofore it has not been a practice to treat the amount expended under the head of Civil Government as a charge against the department, and were such practice adhered to, the deficit of over $1,027,529.02 would be reduced by $246,376.83, leaving the outside service shortage $781,152.19.
From that deduct the amount which the auditors report, with the amount of the years previous to 1895-6, $616,712.99, and it leaves an actual deficit in 1895-6 of $164,439, instead of $781,152. It is so clear that I wonder the hon. the Postmaster General ventures the statement ; I wonder that the hon. the Prime Minister ventured the statement. Is he to include in the expenditure of 1895-6 all these experts say were deficits of the previous years ? The only amount to be deducted is, as I stated before, $68,734. The hon. gentleman may laugh, he may try to explain it, but there is no explanation possible, except that the actual deficit of the Post Office Department in that year was $164,439 This is proved conclusively by the report of his auditors, and I hope the hon. gentleman, in making comparisons again - he is very chary of them in this House-in making comparisons in the country, must
4G3

never say again that there was a deficit of $780,000 in 1895-6 ; because the receipts and expenditures balanced in those years, and show conclusively that instead of the deficit being of that amount, it was really only $164,000.

This report deals with two perfectly distinct transactions. It shows that for many years there had grown up in the Post Office Department a practice of exceeding the appropriation for the year, and if the appropriation was not suffi-to pay the expenditure fer the year, then the shortage was taken out of the appropriation of the succeeding year. This practice went on for many years, and when we took office we found an accumulation of arrears amounting to over $600,000. For example, my hon. friend says that at the commencement of the fiscal year 1895-6 these accumulations amounted to some $600,000, and at the close of the year to $668,000. That is merely the transaction as between a vote of parliament and the expenditure. It is an entirely separate transaction from the question of how much it cost to manage the department for a year, and what the revenue of the department for that year was. Surely, I am not to blame for what happened before we took office. The hon. gentleman admits that for the year 1895-6 they ran behind the appropriation by $6S,000. Well, for the fiscal year ending 1st of July, 1895, according to the figures with which I have nothing to do, there was a deficit of $707,000. My hon. friend will find it in the books ; he won't hold me responsible for this book of
1894-	5. The book he quoted from shows that he began the fiscal year 1895-6 with a deficit on the previous year of $707,000 ; that is, your revenue was that much short of paying up your expenditure. Will the hon. gentleman explain to me by what process of reform they reconstructed that department in that last sad year of their administration, so that they came out with a deficit of only one hundred thousand odd dollars ? No, he won't do that, but instead of that, he tells me, and tells me truly, that he exceeded the appropriation in the year
1895-	6 by $68,000. Add that $68,000 by whi_eh he overrun the appropriation in 1895-6. to the rate of shortage amounting to $707,000. for the previous year, and vou have got $775,000, or within some $4,000 or $5,000 of the deficit the auditors bring out. Let my hon. friend keep quiet.

Parliament votes a certain sum *of money to carry on the department. The Mr. HAGGART.
paragraph to which the hon. gentleman has referred has given proof of the vicious system of the late administration, who spent more each year than they disclosed to parliament, and who, instead of coming down frankly to parliament and asking parliament to vote the shortage failed to disclose it. I do not say it was intentional. I think it was very bad book-keeping owing to the loose state of affairs in the department, but there was the fact that year after year they were spending more than they had the courage to ask parliament to vote, and the result was that when the 1st July came each year, they had to pay out of the year's vote, beginning on the 1st July, an enormous sum of money for debts and services of the past which sum should have been available to carry on the services for the current year. That paragraph that the hon. gentleman has alluded to, shows that at the beginning of the fiscal year 1895-6 there was a deficit of $600,000, representing debts which should have been paid out of the provision of the previous year, but for which there was no money, and which they paid out of the service of 1895-6. They went out that year owing $668,000. When I come down here and ask for money to carry on the service from the 1st July next until the end of the fiscal year, it is not right, and it is contrary to constitutional pi-inciple, that I should be at liberty to take money voted to carry on the servic from the 1st July next to the end of the year, and expend it in paying for services nowbeing performed, and that paragraph in the Auditor's report is an illustration of the loose practice which had grown up and continued for years. If my hon. friend wants some comfort I will give it to him. He has made a mistake; he does not understand this report, and when he comes to think it over to-morrow, he will be surprised that he committed himself to such a view of it. He and I are excellent friends. I know he is incapable of suggesting a thing that he does not believe to be correct. I know that he is speaking conscientiously of what he believes to be the result of this audit. All the same he is entirely in error. I think he will not contradict me again after he has thought it over. I will ask my hon. friend to take the Auditor General's Report, and to take the previous reports, and I will go over them with him, and if he is wrong he will admit it, and if I am wrong I will admit it. But, there is no way of getting over the fact that we receive so much money from the public for the service we perform, and that we pay so much out for the service performed, and that the balance is so much. That is what the auditors tell us in regard to the year 1895-6. They say that for that year the Receiver General received from the public as revenue $3,957,798.51. That was the gross amount the Receiver General obtained from the public.

They gave us the gross revenue from the public for that year, and the gross cost for carrying on the service for that year, $4,985,327.

The hon. gentleman took a vote to pay off the $616,000 or the $680,000, which was simply to correct the book-keeping. The hon. gentleman talks about an expenditure in the post office more than the amount voted for it. It has always been so. The amount voted for the post office is never fixed exactly at the amount which is required for the service, because the Post Office Act places the whole of the moneys received by the department, along with the amount voted by parliament, at the disposal of the Postmaster General. I cannot understand why it is that the hon.
Postmaster General cannot see it. It is impossible that he should not do so if he looks at the figures from 1879 down to 1901. The auditors have included in the amounts to be deducted from that four million odd dollars the deficits of the previous years, $016,000 and $684,000, which leaves a deficit of $780,000. but. if you deduct from that $616,000 which belongs to previous years, the deficit in the post office is only $164,000. I will ask the hon. gentleman to get some expert book-keeper to look into it again, and he will find that my statement is literally and verbally correct to the cent. There is no mystery about it. It is one of the simplest sums in calculation that could be imagined. The simple question which the hon. minister (Sir Louis Davies) asked him is this : In the deductions or in the amount charged for expenditure, is the $616,000 charged ? If it is charged, the deficit of the previous year is included in the year 1895.

If he sends to the library and gets his own report he will find that is correct. Another year went by and I will take his own figures again. The auditors say that the vicious system had been adopted of not getting a large enough vote and carrying a shortage forward and taking the deficit out of the succeeding appropriation.

What reforms did he bring into effect to reduce this deficit which was steadily growing. Surely the hon. gentleman would not discredit the skill of these auditors. One of the auditors, Mr. Cross, is known by my hon. friend from East York (Mr. Maclean), and the other, Mr. Munro, is also known to gentlemen opposite, and no one will question either their skill or their integrity. They had no object except to bring out the actual results. I have every confidence in the accuracy of their audit, and I am sure when my hon. friend (Hon. Mr. Haggart) thinks over the matter he will accept it too.

I wish to ask him if it is his intention to put the post office service in the rural districts-I refer to my own county particularly-in the same state of efficiency as it was before he took office in 1890. In my county where we had a daily mail service through several of the most populous districts before 1896, the Postmaster General immediately on taking office reduced it to a tri-weekly and in some cases to a bi-weekly service. I hear complaints from one end of the county to the other as to the poor mail service at present. An hon. member here complained of a post office being closed in his constituency which served seven or eight families, but in my constituency Marble Rock post office was closed, a post office which for the last twenty years supplied 70 or 80 families. But simply because the postmaster was a Conservative and the mail carrier a Conservative and there were no Liberals living in that part of the country to get the job, Marble Rock post office was closed up and these 70 or 80 families have now to go seven or eight miles to Gananoque to get their mails. I ask him whether it is his intention to restore that office. Another post office in my constituency was closed up, and I put a question on the paper in reference to it, and the Postmaster General gave me the same answer that he gave to my hon. friend, that it was closed because it produced only $6 or $8 of revenue-a statement which I know was not correct; the revenue was more than the amount stated. As soon as I made the statement in the House, my late opponent, Mr. Fredenburg, came to Ottawa and represented to the Postmaster General that there were a few Grits in that district and that the post office must be restored immediately, and it was restored.

I would like to call the attention of hon. gentlemen opposite to this consideration. I think we have evinced on this side, since the beginning of the session, a desire to advance the work of the session and proceed with the estimates in a business-like way. But if we are put to such straits as we have been this afternoon in order to obtain information, I am afraid our task will be more protracted than we anticipate. The discussion arose greatly out of a question I put as to what the deficit was during the past year in the Post Office Department, and reluctantly the hon. minister admitted that there was a deficit of $461,000. Then it took an hour and a half of discussion before we found out-and it was due in great part to the criticism of my hon. friend from Bothwell (Mr. Clancy) that we did find out-that to that deficit must necessarily be added the sum of $90,009 on the service in the Yukon district. That is now admitted by the hon. the Postmaster General. But if we take the statements made by him during the last election and spread broadcast through the province of Quebec, there was a deficit in the postal service in 1895-6 of over $700,000. This statement, my hon. friend from Lanark (Mr. Haggart),

lias shown this afternoon to be absolutely incorrect. Instead of a deficit of $700,000, my hon. friend has shown that the deficit was $164,439, and not one cent more. Then the hon. the Postmaster General stated at a public meeting in East Grey, not only that the deficit in 1S95-6 was $700,000, but that we would soon reach a period when we would have no deficit at all. In the early part of the afternoon, I questioned the hon. gentleman as to how far we were suffering from a deficit at present, and he would give no answer save the general observation that probably this year there would be no deficit at all. I think the hon. gentleman must admit that a great deal of time has been lost in arriving at the facts. And when I saw my hon. friend the member for Kingston (Mr. Britton), with his extremely outwardly virtuous appearance, rising in this House and saying he could not see-just like a man who was exhibiting a juggler-where there was any deception, I must say the lack of frankness displayed was significant of anything but business methods by a business administration. It would have been a great deal better for the hon. the Postmaster General to have come down and told us exactly, at the very inception, what the amount of the deficit really is in a service, in which there must necessarily be a considerable deficit, if it is properly carried on. And the three or four hours that we have taken to find out the facts and place them before the country might have been better occupied in remedying certain individual grievances which have been pointed out by several members and met by the Postmaster General in a very flippant spirit. We had the hon. member for North Leeds (Mr. Taylor) pointing out that a certain post office had been closed and then reopened on the representation of Mr. Predenburg, and then closed again. Why, we have no explanation from the Postmaster General, who simply got up and smilingly told us that Mr. Predenburg had made out a good case, and that no doubt if the hon. member for Leeds would come before him again with a certain case decided not long ago, and make out a good claim, he too would have justice. If we are to get through the estimates with expedition, we require a little more frankness on the part of ministers of the Crown. I have confidence in the Minister of Public Works that when we come to the estimates of his department, we will have less trouble in arriving at the basic figures and dealing with those estimates promptly and in a business-like manner.
I find an increase of $49,523.88 in salaries and allowances, outside service. Is the Postmaster General disposed to give us some information as to what that increase consists of ?

I know that the Marble Rock post office in my constituency served fifty families, but the postmaster was a Conservative, and the mail carrier was a Conservative, and the only way the Postmaster General could dispose of them was to close the post office, and he did so. These fifty families have to travel miles to the nearest post office for their mail, and although he gives them a reduction of a cent on their letters, some of them have to spend a whole day going to the post office. I have received two letters from prominent men in my constituency in reference to the postal service the Postmaster General is now giving in that country. Mr. R. Harvey, miller of Lyndhurst, writes as follows: - ' George Taylor, Esq., M.P. :
' Our people of Ellisville, Long Point and Sweet's Corners are all up in arms about the change of mail routes. It is a shame to withdraw the daily mail from that section. Mail going to these post offices now lays over in Lyndhurst from Fridity until Monday. Here are three cheese factories and a well-settled community of intelligent people placed in a worse condition than if they were in the backwoods.'
For years these people enjoyed a daily mail, but now they have got it only twice a week. On that route there are four cheese factories, and a thickly settled community; they are worse off for mail service now than if they were in the backwoods.
So, it will be seen that I brought this matter to the attention of the Postmaster General over two years ago. Marble Rock post office, which served fifty families, was closed, and no steps have been taken yet to reopen it. The mail route, changed from daily to triweekly, remains the same as before. A thickly settled community are served with a tri-weekly mail, and have been for two years.

The hon. gentleman tells this Committee that he has arranged a heading apart from the post office estimates under which is to be found an item of $100,000-and it will be a growing item, no doubt.

Postmaster General, in the face of that, maintain that he should fairly compare that deficit of $781,000 with the deficit which he had apparently in the next year when he admits that to provide for the deficit he got a sum of money given to him by the hon. Finance Minister, by special grant, and which was charged to capital account ? How can he ask an intelligent House and country to accept his statement ? The Postmaster General here informs us that during the year ending June 30, 1896, there was a deficit of $780,000, and that he had only a deficit of $60,000 the next year. He has, I think, conclusively established the contention made by the hon. the ex-Postmaster General (Mr. Haggart), that there was no such deficit for 1896. He has proven that hon. gentleman's contention by the facts and figures given in his own report. There was nothing in the receipts or expenditure of the department in the year 1897, that would ccount for the disappearance of that alleged deficit, and I think we may accept as a matter now satisfactorily established that the deficit did not at all belong to the year terminating on June 30, 1896, but was the increment of a series of arrearages extending over a number of years. Therefore, I think we must charge the hon. Postmaster General with a lack of ingenuousness when he seeks to put the deficit for 1896 at $780,000. as compared with the deficit that existed in the following year. There are one or two matters to which I want to call the attention of the hon. the Postmaster General. 1 suppose he is exceedingly anxious to make his department self-sustaining as soon as possible. I know he is claiming a great deal of credit for cutting down the expenditure by refusing to let contracts to mail carriers without tender, and that he has saved a great deal of money, by, in some cases, breaking up contracts and reletting

470
them during the term in which they were to run. I would like to call his attention to the tact that some person is taking liberties with his'' department in the county of Pictou, in Nova Scotia, that he is taking contracts froni men who have efficiently discharged their work, and giving them to others who have not tendered for them. It may be a coincidence, but it is a fact nevertheless, that a man who has been deprived of the privilege of tendering and who has lost two contracts, the requirements of which he has performed in a manner so efficient as to secure the commendation and support of the people of that locality, is a Conservative, and a very active one, and that the gentleman to whom the contract has been given without tender is one, whatever his other qualifications may be, who is a strong supporter of the hon. gentleman and his friends. I am sure the hon. Postmaster General will put that matter right now that I have, in my place, in parliament, brought it to his notice and showed him how seriously some of his officials are departing from that magnificent line of conduct that he marked out for himself when he took office. Mr. Gammon, of Kiver John, was deprived of his contract, and another gentleman, Mr. Ritchie, of River John, received the contract although he did not apparently ask for it. Certainly he did not tender for it. There is another matter. I find, that, like my hon. friend from King's county, N.B. (Mr. Fowler), certain postmasters in Pictou county are marked for destruction or promotion. In many cases, despite largely-signed petitions from those in the neighbourhood, they have been dismissed and the post offices removed to other places for no reason whatever except a political reason. That is a shame. It is a pity that men can be found in our country so small as to covet an office of $10 or $20 a year, and that an administration can be found so contemptible as to listen to the demands of defeated candidates who wish to wreak their vengeance on men who refused to support them, and who stood in a manly fashion by their party. It is a sad thing to know that Canada is governed by a set of men who will lend themselves to such contemptible conduct. Even in cases where Liberal friends asked the post office to be left where it was, at the instance of defeated candidates the whole public service of Canada is being dragged down by the acts of this administration. It is a miserable, petty, jjicayune piece of business. The government is raising up for itself a fine monument in showing that it is the tool of creatures who are capable of asking the dismissal of men holding these small offices, simply on the ground that they refused to vote Liberal.

This gentleman who has cut him out did not get the contract, 1 am informed, by open competition. I would like the Postmaster General to take a note of it, because it may not be too late to see that the pettiest party politics of that character should not be permitted to prevail. Mr. Gammon, I am glad to know, is not dependent on that, small contract, and it should be known that he was not cut out of the contract fairly in open competition.

It will he premature, therefore, to provide for salaries not provided for by any existing statute. I am at this moment, however, considering the subject, and have been considering it. I have not yet had an opportunity of discussing it with my colleagues, but I will do so at the earliest moment. I cannot say more than that to-night. My hon. friend will excuse me if I cannot be more explicit, as I have not the power to be. With reference to reducing the rate on drop letters in cities from two cents to one cent, that is a subject which has received a good deal of attention in cities, where there is already free delivery, and where public opinion is altogether in favour of the reduction. But I very much doubt if the same view obtains outside of the cities. The cost of maintaining a free city delivery is very considerable, and until the rest of the country gets free delivery, I fail to see how you could justify giving a special preference to the inhabitants of cities. There are others to be considered who pay largely towards the expenses of the service. If a city is desirous of having a reduction from two cents to one cent, let it pay for the reduction by commuting the amount of the difference at a fixed sum per annum, and obtain the one-cent drop letter rate in that way. But up to the present moment I have not seen my way to discriminate in favour of cities.

A rural mail delivery has been tried for a short time in the United States, and one of my officers has been there taking observations, and is now preparing a report upon it. Mr. Ross, the assistant postmaster at Toronto, has been specially charged with that duty. I do not



know what conclusion he lias arrived at, as lie lias not yet made his report. I would not be right, probably in criticising the United States administration, but I think it will turn out that they are undertaking a much larger project than they contemplated when they began it. As to what it will cost, no one can very well anticipate. I had some conversation with some of the officers charged with the matter, and if I rightly understood them, they view with some alarm the task they have undertaken. It would mean a rural delivery over an area equal to that of Europe, with a population only one-fifth of that of Europe ; and Canada has an area equal to that of the United States. It is a very large problem, and could only be entered upon after the most careful consideration.

The Postmaster General has laid down the rule that a post office may be cut off on the ground of its small revenue. We have also heard a great deal about the benefit of the two-cent postage rate. Those of us who live in the rural districts are not so much concerned in that reduction as we are to have the post offices at convenient points, where we can get daily mails. An office in a country place may be a very good distributing office, but a very poor receiving office; and if we should be deprived of our post offices on the ground of their small revenues, while we have now to travel considerable distances to get our mails, we would be compelled to go a great deal further. Then, with regard to the payment of postmasters, I think, the postmasters of towns and cities are paid a great deal better than the country postmasters, who have probably to keep their offices open much longer. In the rural districts we want the daily papers-though it would be a good thing for the government if the daily papers did not come-because they inform us of what is going on. A rural postmaster may sometimes be obliged to have his office open as early as six o'clock in the morning, when the stage goes by, and also late at night. I want to draw the attention of the Postmaster General to these points, so that he will consider that while a rural post office may not produce much revenue, it may be a very useful distributing office, and the postmaster may have to keep it open even longer hours than the city offices.

He would then find that this service would be so much appreciated that the country would never allow these hon. gentlemen to remain in their seats on that side of the House unless they continued it.

I cannot refrain from putting in a plea for those postmasters and postmistresses who have to keep these rural post offices open almost day and night, because in the country, when our work is done and we have had our supper, it is often late in the night before we can go for our letters, and these postmasters and postmistresses have to keep their offices open to wait upon us. I think their case is deserving of every consideration, and I hope that when Christmas time comes, the hon. gentleman will have something on the Christmas tree to repay them for the work they are doing.
Let me add just another word. I often come down to the city, and of course, like

people from the country visiting the city, am quite an observer, and I see strong, double-fisted fellows-as big as the Postmaster General himself, walking to the post office two or three times a day just to see if there is anything there. It would be economy to have the mails brought to their addresses at least once a day and utilize these big strong fellows in some other kind of work.

Being somewhat interested in the matter, I wrote as strong a letter as I could to the Postmaster General, asking him to continue the daily service, and, in my letter, I pointed out that in the polling subdivision where the post office was situated, only three Conservative votes had been polled in the general election. This, I told the Postmaster General, was not said to influence his judgment according to lines of political bias, but merely to show him the high grade of intelligence of the people in that neighbourhood, in the hope that such an intelligent people might not be deprived of the daily service and the daily newspaper. The reply came back from the Postmaster General, in terms courteous, but firm : I do not consider it in the public interest to continue this as a daily service ; I must insist on a reduction to a tri-weekly service.

between the department and this company. It would appear that some old system had existed, under which the company were paid a proportion of the postal revenue for carrying the mail. This led to a controversy, and probably made it impossible to close the account within the fiscal year. Isolated cases of this kind must always occur, but, substantially, all the expenditures for carrying on the service of the department for the fiscal year are disposed of in time to be included in the accounts of the year.

There was a very general complaint a year or two ago that, owing to the reduction of the postal rate from three cents to two cents, the revenue of postmasters was reduced. I brought the subject up in parliament last session, and, if my memory serves me correctly, the Postmaster General observed that lie thought the revenue would still be practically the same. I am still Informed by postmasters that they suffer on account of the reduction in their revenues. I would re-echo the sentiment expressed by one or two other members here to-night that the Postmaster General might well consider the desirability of reducing the salaries allowed to postmasters in large cities, like Toronto, Montreal and Winnipeg, where postmasters receive from $3,000 to $5,000, and possibly more, and allow the rural postmasters some extra allowance or increased rate.

In that locality there are 400 or 500 voters, and of course a much larger population, and they only have a mail twice a week. These people have been asking for better mail accommodation for some time; I do not know whether the matter has been brought to the attention of the Postmaster General. There are also in this locality a number of factories along the shore, and the population is considerably augmented during the summer months. There are also a number of cheese factories, and in Abrams Village a number of stores. These people have a grievance in being deprived of a daily mail. It is only about five miles to a railway station, and there is every reason why there-should not be a daily mail to that locality. The country served by these post offices is fifteen or twenty miles in extent, and I notice the revenue is nearly treble the salaries received by the postmasters.

I have not taken up more than a few minutes' time of the Committee, and I must confess that the hon. Postmaster General has not given me a very satisfactory answer to the questions I propounded to him. The answer he made was that the question of making an increase in the salary of the letter carriers was receiving his consideration. I hope that consideration will be favourable, because, from the terms of the petition which has been sent in by the letter carriers, he must see that their plight is a very serious one. They point to the fact, that, notwithstanding the determination of the hon. gentleman to make this a cheap country to live in, their experience has been, since these hon. gentlemen came into power, that the cost of living has increased substantially and that the difficulty of eking out an existence on the salaries they receive in cities and large centres of population has been very much accentuated. The hon. Postmaster General is aware that in violation of the precedent set by his predecessors in the past, in violation of what was originally laid down in the administration of the department, these letter carriers who went in at a minimum salary of $30 a month, or $360 a year, have been deprived of the statutory increase of $30 a year. Some were deprived of it for three years in succession, and these men, by the act of the hon. Postmaster General, were unwillingly compelled to contribute in that time a sum equivalent to $180, to assist the hon. Postmaster General in making both sides of the post office ledger balance. I appeal to the hon. Postmaster General to take the situation that these men find themselves in

to-day into his most serious consideration, and I ask the hon. gentleman if, in the item under discussion, he has made provision sufficient to give each letter carrier who is not receiving the maximum provided for under the Act an increase of $30 a year.

In no way whatever has the gentleman done one single thing in the nature of political partisanship except to go and cast a silent vote. Surely the Postmaster General will not drive him out of Ins office for that.

ject, so that hon. members may understand for once and all whether there was a deficit at the end of 1896, or not. I would suggest to the hon. the Postmaster General that the time has now arrived when a change should be made in the system of keeping accounts in his department. I fail to see what there is to be gained by continuing from year to year two separate accounts, one for the Yukon district and another for the Dominion of Canada. I think that four or five years of keeping the two separate accounts is quite sufficient, and that from the beginning of next year all the accounts should be kept under the one head, and the question as to what is the exact deficit would no longer be disputed, but be very readily understood.
It may be said that that would not be fair for the purposes of comparison, but the hon. gentleman must remember that some of his colleagues have changed their methods of book-keeping, notably the Minister of Railways and Canals. We find now that many items are charged by that hon. gentleman to capital account which were not so charged by the previous government, and consequently his report is of very little use for the purpose of comparison. I might take also the Trade and Navigation Returns, in which the imports and exports are entered on a different basis, and it is difficult indeed to make comparisons unless we eliminate those items concerning which the system has been changed.
I think the hon. the Postmaster General would increase the value of his report very much, and make it much clearer if he would just make one account of the whole matter and not have two separate accounts. With reference to the deficit, which he claims existed at the end of 1896, I fail to see, after having looked into this matter very carefully, and after having listened carefully to everything said, why the Postmaster General should persist in claiming there was a deficit. What took place is simply this. At the end of 1895-6, on the 30th June, 1896, payment of a large number of contracts matured. The time for paying these contracts arrived on the night of the 30th June, 1896, but they could not possibly be paid at one o'clock in the morning of the 1st July, 1897. Consequently there was a large sum of money unpaid by the Post Office Department oil the morning of the 1st July. That practice had been carried on for years, and I believe dates as far back as the time when Sir Oliver Mowat was Postmaster General of Canada. These contracts were paid after the 1st July, out of the appropriation for the following year. They were not a deficit, but simply items which had matured and were unpaid, but were no evidence that the revenue of the Post Office Department ' was not equal to the expenditure. It seems to me that the Postmaster General has simply been playing with the House and

the country for the last three or four years, treating us as so many novices or children, and expecting us to believe that an account which only matured on the night of the 30th June, and was not settled at one o'clock in the morning of the 1st July, was a deficit. To my mind that is so plain that it would be foolish to waste my further time discussing it.

As the country grows, the service is constantly increasing, and doubtless this estimate will not he sufficient. We have had hon. gentlemen to-night pressing the government to increase the mail service. This is an increase of $20,000. Probably $10,000 will be set apart for land service, stages, &c., and $10,000 for railway service. There are railways approaching completion, and applications are coming in for mail service. With a growing service, an increased vote is necessary.
