We have met to do business, and we should be ready to do it. But, when the First Minister tells us that the government are not responsible for the Auditor General's Report not being down, I cannot agree with him-and for two reasons. In the first place, the Auditor General's Report will be prepared promptly if the ministers present their documents to the Auditor General in good time to give him the opportunity of going over and revising them. And when the Auditor General's Report is prepared, it is a matter for the printer ; and the printers are under the direct control of the government. If the Auditor General has no control over the limiting of the documents that he presents, the ministers have. There must be control somewhere, and where is it V The Printing Department is in the control of the ministers themselves. We hear today that the government are sending part of their printing down to the city of Montreal ; and I am told by printers who know what it means, that the printing of the Trade and Navigation Returns is most profitable, because it is printed in both languages, and the same figures are retained for both the French and English edition, so that it is a doubly profitable transaction for the printers. That was sent down to the favoured newspapers, giving them enormous profits, though the ministers state at regular rates. Well, the regular rate is double the rate for column work, and it is double rate again for printing in English and French, though as a matter of fact it is printed in the one language only, the figures being the same for both languages. And still we are waiting for the Trade and Navigation Returns that should have been in the hands of the public many months ago.

Minister of Finance (Hon, Mr. Fielding) says, one department of the government has for the moment broken down and it is not able to discharge its proper duties. Consequently, not being in a position to ask for supplies, having none of their measures ready for the consideration of the House, they propose that we should take up only such business as the opposition shall bring forward. I think this is a very unfortunate position for the government, and since the business of the government is in our hands they might very well listen to the suggestion of the hon. gentleman who has his business ready and rest over to-morrow before we tackle that.
