I move that an address be voted for copies of the evidence, exhibits and report of the inquiry held at Inverness, in the county of Megantic, on August 21, 1900, by Hon. Mr. Justice White, of Sherbrooke, in the matter of the post office of Kinnear's Mills.
I deem it my duty, in my capacity of member for Megantic, to move for those papers, and the reason why I make that . motion is to show the interested parties how anxious the government have shown themselves to do justice to whomsoever justice was due. Here are the facts of the case On December 6, 1899, a letter was mailed at the post office of Kinnear's Mills, being supposed to contain $200. As the money had disappeared, the interested parties made a complaint, and an inquiry was held by the post office inspector, Mr. Bolduc, of Quebec.
Mr. Bolduc reported that the letter contained no money.
As the interested party was dissatisfied with that report, a second inquiry was held


by the post office inspector for the district of Ottawa, Mr. Hawkins. That gentleman made a report exactly similar to the first. As there prevailed a great deal of excitation in the locality, and as the interested parties were not yet satisfied, I obtained from the hon. the Postmaster General (Mr. Mulock) a public inquiry, which was held by Hon. Mr. Justice White, of Sherbrooke. The latter reported in the same sense as the former reports just referred to.
As the interested parties were not yet satisfied, the more so as those reports did not confirm them in their claims, and as they pretend that the evidence given is favourable to them, I move for the production of the evidence, exhibits and report of the inquiry, in order to show that the government is willing to render full justice.-Carried.

or iron, or some such material product. The hon. gentleman must have some definite object in his mind, and I would suggest that he could best attain that object by so framing his resolution as to include it definitely, instead of requiring the return of an immense mass of matter that would simply be useless to him, and that would involve a large amount of labour in its preparation. If he would amend the present resolution by putting the word ' railway ' before the word ' corporations,' and say 1 now incorporated or being operated in Canada,' he could later introduce another resolution covering the additional ground that he has in his mind.

ask the First Minister to allow me to make an explanation in reference to an item that appeared in the Montreal Gazette this morning. Under the heading ' The Harbour at Midland ' there is a statement made that a deputation waited yesterday upon the Minister of Public Works (Hon. Mr. Tarte), and the writer uses these words :
The representation is that by increasing the present depth of water twenty feet, the grain shipments can be doubled. . . . Many heavy steamships now unloading at Buffalo could and would come to Midland, were there sufficient depth of water.
I wi%U to take the earliest opportunity of correcting that statement. If such a statement were made to the minister it is entirely incorrect, because there is already at that port considerably over twenty feet of water, and vessels carrying over a quarter of a million bushels of grain are to be seen there at all times. I can only assume that the gentleman who sent the despatch was wrongly informed. I hope the information that was given to the Minister of Public Works as to the requirements of that harbour was more correct than the information given the gentleman who sent this despatch.
