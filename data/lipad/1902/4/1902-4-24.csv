It is kept well ahead of the actual needs of the roads, large enough to keep engines and cars in good, healthy condition, and rolling stock is being constantly rebuilt. Its capacity for repairs is flexible, because men can be taken off new work to do repairs when they are accumulating too fast. The general policy being to rebuild both engines and cars instead of wasting time and material in patching up 3tock that is old and worn out, and which, owing to the march of improvements, has become too small and obsolete.
Now, this is the statement of an experienced man as to what a modern railway requires. Let me ask, Mr. Chairman, is there any reason known to any member of this House why, in equipping, building and repairing we should discard modern methods upon a government road 1 Is there any reason why a government road should be an exception to all other roads ? Is there any reason why a government road should remain out of date ? Will anybody tell me why a government road should be an out-of-date institution, that it should be, either as to its passenger equipment or its road-bed, a discredit to the country ? Is not the country entitled to respect from an enlightened and proper administration of the Intercolonial Railway, that it should be as good, as complete, as comfortable, as speedy, as convenient and in as good condition as any other railway in Canada ? Ho the people of this country approve, or do they not, of having the railway which belongs to them in such a shape that it will reflect no discredit upon either them or the government ? I venture to say that the man who interprets the sentiment of the people of Canada in any other way, misinterprets that sentiment. While it may suit the purposes of the opponents of the government to give currency to a view among the people that there lias been wasteful extravagance in the enormous sums of money, as they choose to characterize them, which have been laid out upon the road, I say they are attempting to deceive the people, they are misleading the people in a way which is not worthy of any political party ; and until they can show that in the expenditures we have made upon this railway, on capital or any other account, we have been wasteful, that we have made expenditures without reasonable necessity, they have no case against the administration of the government railway.

The MINISTER OP' RAILWAYS AND CANALS. That of the mechanical superintendent, Mr. Joughins. Then he passes from what he considers ought to be and are the requirements of a first-class road, an up-to-date road, to what our conditions and circumstances are in that regard.

On taking an inventory of our locomotives, we shall find that the freight engines are altogether too small to haul freight with economy. In writing to the general manager on June 18th, in the fiscal year 1897-8, I said as follows : ' Referring to the new engines which we think cf ordering, it seems to me that we ought first to purchase freight engines exclusively, because the grades on our road are so heavy that our present freight engines are totally unable to handle a paying train of freight, and because our passenger service seems to be fairly weTl provided for at the present time, at least it does not demand such a radical reform as the freight service. If we decide to get freight locomotives, we ought to buy as large as it is possible to use on our road-bed.' And this still appears to me to hold good. .	. - . It is
well recognized that very much greater economies can be inaugurated and practiced in hauling freight than passenger trains without detriment to. the service, that such improvements persistently carried out are one of 'the essentials necessary to place a road on a paying basis, and to meet the competition of its neighbours.
Our greatest handicap in endeavouring to reach the goal of economy is the size and condition of the 156 engines employed in hauling freight. They are altogether too small, not one could be considered a modern engine for main line service, and most of them were too small even according to progressive railroad ideas the day they were purchased.
Now, this is a statement of the mechanical superintendent. Whether that statement is correct, whether his judgment is sound or not, I venture to appeal to any man filling any responsible position such as that of mechanical superintendent on any of the railways of Canada, or of any other country on tiie continent, whether the statement lie makes in this regard is not supported and sustained by the judgment of every man of experience in the same direction.
In looking at our list of both passenger and freight engines, we see that we have 143 engines with cylinders 17 inches or less in diameter, and only 57 engines with 18 inches, and six with 19 inches, the latter being purchased only within the last four or five years, and then for passenger service.
That is, prior to 1898.
They were all purchased for passenger service.
Those four or five having nineteen inch cylinders.
For many years engines with cylinders even so large as 18 inches have not been economically useful in freight service, and the smaller sizes should have disappeared long ago from our main line. We are now purchasing engines with 21 inch cylinders, and With almost double the power of the largest we hitherto possessed.
The Canada Atlantic, a level road, have not, I believe, bought less than 18-inch engines during the last fifteen or twenty years, the Canadian Pacific not a single one since 1887, while we have bought or rebuilt 33 engines of less than that size during the last ten years.
Perhaps I could show more clearly what I
mean when 1 say that the engines are too small by comparing the weight and power of a modern freight engine with the engines we now possess. The best of our old locomotives weighed about 50 tons, and could haul 550 tons up a 1 per cent grade, and we have only 12"" of that capacity, the rest are smaller, some weighing only 30 tons. A modern freight engine, such as we are purchasing, weighs S3 tons, and has a hauling capacity of 1,100 tons up the same grade. On calculating the hauling power of each freight engine which we own and adding them together, we find :.hat it amounts to 56,000 tons up a grade of 1 per cent, and that if we had the same number of modern engines they would haul 166,000 tons up the same grade.
That is three times as much. And, mark you, in the incidental cost of running the trains, taking into account items such as oil and waste, the rate of wages paid, &c., it would cost practically the same to run a train hauling 300, or 400, or 500 tons as it would be to run a train hauling 1,100 or 1,200 tons.
There is not very much to say about freight cars, except that they have not been designed large enough, and that during the last eight or ten years we have purchased fropi 2,000 t.o 3,000 cars of 20 tons capacity, which should have been 30 tons. To me it seems incomprehensible why 20-ton ears should have been made up to 1898, when every one else years ago had recognized the value of the larger car, and it is, I believe, needless for me to point out its advantages.
Now, there is his statement. He winds up with this :
It is difficult to speak with certainty of what ought to be done to meet the demands of the I-assenger traffic. Both in regard to locomotives and cars it is more a question of competition, appearanoes, speed, comfort and safety than one of reducing expenses per train mile.
I feel that you are quite familiar with the facts and requirements in regard to this, and that I need not say very much about it beyond pointing out that our passenger engines are small and. that the condition of our trains is anything but a good advertisement for our road. A stranger visiting the provinces for the first time, would conclude from their appearance that the road was very much embarrassed financially, so poor that it could not afford to make a decent appearance, unable even :o spend1 enough to keep them clean, and when we know that they belong to the Canadian government and therefore in some degree represent it before the world, we cannot help feeling ashamed for their appearance ; our cars were built long before comfort was considered a necessity in railway travelling and we have not been renewing our cars at such a rate as to be able to say that we have a respectable and modern equipment.

I will let the hon. gentleman have it such as it is. Now, Mr. Chairman, just let me state the condition in an abbreviated form. So far as the equipment of the Intercolonial Railway is concerned, we had not a dining car on it. We had not a real first-class car on it. We had not a first-class sleeping car on the road, as everybody knows. Travelling on the Intercolonial over night, leaving our train and taking a car on the Canadian Pacific Railway or Grand Trunk Railway, the comparison which any person would make was open to comment and the subject of general remark. They had all the modern appliances and equipments; we had none of them. The first dining car that was put on the line was put on in 1898, or early in 1899, and so in regard to up to date coaches and sleeping cars. You have heard that we had no locomotives that were Hon. Mr. BLAIR.
capable of hauling more than 600 tons. I can give the committee a list showing when these locomotives were obtained, when they were purchased, how old they were and what the capacity was for hauling. You have the general statement of Mr. Joughins that these engines would not haul 500 tons and everybody who has gone over the Intercolonial Railway in times past noticed the character of the train service, and even down to this date, has seen more trains of perhaps 180, 200 and 300 tons hauled by locomotives than trains of a larger tonnage. One hundred and eighty, or 200 tons was more than the average of the whole tonnage of some of these' trains and yet large locomotives which will cost no more for running, although they cost a little more for fuel, would be able to haul five times that amount of tonnage up our grades without any difficulty whatever, and they are doing it to-day. The only thing that I regret is that we have not been able to get these large locomotives manufactured and put into service fast enough. We have not begun to realize the advantages which will accrue from the equiqment of the road with large locomotives, so that we are yet in no position to claim that we are fully and completely equipped.
We are spending, this year, $400,000 on capital account for rails. We must put down heavy rails to bring our road up to date. I think that is too obvious to need any argument to sustain it. We must have heavier trains, heavier locomotives and heavier cars, and the truest economy, as well as the safety and security of the travelling public, requires that we should have these heavy rails and that we should have tne bridges strengthened so that these trains may safely pass over our line. We have spent $200,000 within the last three years out of capital for the purpose of strengthening these bridges. I would have been better pleased and the road would have been better served if we had spent double or treble that amount during that time. It would have been better if the government had spent more than that for new rails and more rails, but I think hon. gentlemen would be inclined to assume that if it had been possible for the government to have authorized estimates for a larger sum they would have done so. If they had thought that parliament would have approved of larger estimates they would have so asked, but we must move cautiously and moderately in these things. We cannot do as company roads do, circulate their stock, get $20,000,000 at one time and do the things which are necessary. We must go to work in a more moderate way. The expenditures we have made in these years have been less than we would have liked to have made. The expenditure for sidings and accommodations has been very large and will amount up to this time, to about $2,000,000. Does anybody say

that with heavier trains and heavier locomotives we could get along without increased sidings ? I intend to have a memorandum of the exact number, of miles-there were scores of miles-which have been added to the railway in the way of additional sidings during the last two or three years. I will get the information if it can be obtained for me before we get through the discussion on the Intercolonial Railway votes. But, we have spent $2,000,000 for this purpose. Does anybody say that that expenditure was not necessary ? You had better pull up your rails and tear up your road and tell the people that you do not want a railway down there than run it in the twopenny, halfpenny way in which it was going on. If you are going to have a railway that is creditable to Canada you cannot move one peg without doing the whole work. You cannot have locomotives that will economically carry the freight unless you have heavier rails, longer sidings and larger cars. All these things follow in the train, one upon the other, just as naturally as day follows night, and the necessity is just as complete as it would be in any other condition. Now, then, I say that having increased the size of the car and the length of the train, in order that the road may be worked at all, we had to have, as rapidly as we could get them, increased length of sidings from one end to the other of the road.	,	,
As to the expenditure at the Straits of Canso. nobody seems to have taken any objection to that. The little freight sheds that we had along the line with their limited accommodation ; the little stations and the little offices which did not suffice ; these had to be increased and multiplied, and during the last five years we have had to spend $1,000,000 in that work. Shall it be said that when people along the whole length of the Intercolonial Railway were crying out for reasonable facilities to enable them to do their business ; shall it be said that we should turn a deaf ear to their appeals because some one on the other side of the House is going to cry out : ' What an enormous expense,' and because some one on the opposite side claiming to represent his party, may say : This is a sinkhole for the money of the country. Sir, I do not think we would be worthy of the positions we occupy as responsible ministers of the Crown if we had yielded timidly to any such out-crv as that, and refused to give the people of Canada the accommodation which they demanded on the Intercolonial Railway. My business as the Minister of Railways is to present to my colleagues reasonable demands to meet the needs of the railway. As a matter of fact I have never approached this question in any spirit of extravagance, but on the contrary, I have always been behind the requirements of the road. And when I presented these claims, I must say that they have always been received in a
spirit of fairness and consideration by my colleagues. They were not, perhaps, met to the extent which I would have desired, but still they were met to an extent which I could see was as far as the government could reasonably go at the time and under the circumstances. Sir, I am prepared to justify, to justify in the face of the world, what we have done in order to make the Intercolonial Railway a railroad which is creditable to Canada to-day, and which if. we have not brought up to an absolute state of perfection at the present time, we hope to attain in the future. I would like to get a candid avowal from the gentlemen on the other side of the House who have gone over that road, as to what they think of the improvements we have made and the increased facilities which we have afforded. They certainly have told me individually that they much appreciate the improvements which have taken place. They have commended in no carping spirit the splendid and convenient service which -we have given to the people of the country. Let it be remembered that the Intercolonial Railway is not for the people of the maritime provinces alone ; let it not be forgotten that the commercial people of all Canada, and that the travelling public of all Canada are participants in the comforts and facilities which are afforded on that road. I am satisfied, for my part, that the people of the entire Dominion desired that the intercolonial Railway should be put in proper shape. Let me ask : What was the condition of the Canadian Pacific Railway before we entered on our era of improvement on the Intercolonial Railway ? Are there not gentlemen here who travelled over the Canadian Pacific Railway before we brought the Intercolonial Railway up to its present standard, and do they not know it to be a fact that the better quality of the service, and the greater comfort and the greater convenience which we inaugurated on the Intercolonial Railway stimulated the other road to our example. I think hon. members on both sides of the House will recognize that there is a place which a government railway can properly fill in every country ; it can be an example and a stimulus to other railway companies throughout the country to attain to the same high standard of service. And, Sir, if a government railroad does no other good than that, it does a very great deal for the benefit of the country.
I do not believe that under all the circumstances, the people of Canada will say that we have expended one dollar more on the Intercolonial Railway than we should have expended. I say that my hon. friend from Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) for instance, does not represent the people of Montreal or the people of his own district when he speaks in the contemptuous way he does of the Intercolonial Railway. He does not represent the ideas of the people when he treats the Intercolonial Railway as if it were

unworthy of serious consideration. I am quite sure that the people will not approve of what he has said in that regard, for X know that the citizens of Montreal are more than pleased with the results of our bringing the Intercolonial Railway to that city.
Now, Sir, I think I have proven that the expenditure on capital has been necessary and justifiable. But some people have said, as if it deserved serious attention at the hands of parliament :	Oh, but you have
spent sums on capital account which ought to have been paid out of the earnings of the road. In other words, they declare that we have not adopted a system of book-keeping w'hich would commend itself to an expert chartered accountant. Now that may be all very well ; it may be a very nice argument to address lo a meeting of shareholders of any incorporated company, if these shareholders were raising the question as to whether the expenditure for the year was an expenditure that ought to be taken from earnings which would reduce the yearly dividends, or whether it ought to be included in bonds, and charged by way of bonded liability upon the undertaking, so that future shareholders would have to bear the charge, and the present shareholders would get a larger rate of interest. The shareholders in these incorporated companies change from year to year ; one set of men may be shareholders to-day and a different body of men would be shareholders in the next month, or in the next year, and the question raised by gentlemen on the other side in reference to the charging of the expenditure on the Intercolonial Railway would be a profitable one for consideration under such circumstances. But is that the situation with regard to the Intercolonial Railway ? I contend that it is not. The Intercolonial Railway belongs to the people of the country, and as such its owners are not in the same position as would be the shareholders in a joint stock corporation. The government lasts for ever ; though its personnel may change, yet it is always the government of Canada that is administering the Intercolonial Railway, and the people wTio own it are Canadians, whether they be the people who are living to-day or the people who will live years hence. It is the country that is concerned ; and it is not particularly a question of book-keeping for them.
I propose to show, Sir, that even if it were, there is nothing in the argument which lion, gentlemen opposite have advanced upon that point.
My first proposition is this, that if the need of making this expenditure is conceded in order to bring the road up to the condition to which we are bringing it, and in order that it may be still further improved, there is only one way in which it can be done, and that is by borrowing, or, in other words, on capital account-why ? Because the earnings of the road do not afford a sufficient margin. Even if they produced each year the largest surplus we ever had,

",,,The MINISTER OF RAILWAYS AND CANALS.,
38063,ca.proc.d.1902-04-24.2.4.28,1902-04-24,26662264-1d8d-4546-8cd0-5b0cea432119,ca.m.2354,Hon. Mr. BLAIR.,Minister of Railways and Canals,SUPPLY.,,,"that would only be a mere drop in the bucket for the purpose of reconstituting and reconstructing a great railway. How long would it be before we would put down new rails (.u the whole road if we had to take the cost of them out of earnings ? How long before we could put: down new sidings or provide new equipment if we had to wait until we could do so out of earnings ? It happens that this read has never been, and perhaps it never may be, a great surpluspaying road. Conditions exist which may for some years to come control the financial results of the undertaking. It would be unfair to hold the Intercolonial to the same strict rule to which you would hold railways which are built for commercial reasons, and in view of commercial considerations exclusively. I woader to what extent commercial considerations entered into the question of the location of the Intercolonial Railway. If we had been building a road to yield a handsome net return to the government every year from its earnings, who would undertake to build a road by the roundabout route which the Intercolonial Railway has taken V I do not suggest that it should not have taken that route. In the conditions of the country at the time, I think it was important that it should have done so, because the people in that portion of the country would otherwise not have had railway accommodation at all. But do not let it be asserted that because those conditions controlled the location of the route, for that reason the Intercolonial Railway ought to be despised and neglected, and left in the condition of a second or third-class road because, located where it is, it did not promise any large financial results and does not give any such results. I claim, therefore, that the position, so far as the question of improving the road out of capital or out of earnings is concerned, is exactly the same as respects its control by the country, and there is not one dollar of difference either to any individual in Canada or to the Finance Minister of Canada, in the result at the end of the year, whether you improve it out of earnings clout of capital. Would it not be fallacious and absurd for me to come down to parliament and ask for an appropriation of two or three or four millions out of earnings for the purpose of improving the road ? If I did so, who would be the first person in the House to condemn such a proposition ? My hon. friends opposite; and what would they say ? They would charge me with beinig guilty of a shallow pretense ; they would charge me with perpetrating a fraud on the parliament of Canada in asking for two or three or four millions out of the earnings of the road when it never had more than $122,000 of net surplus iu any year in its whole history. They would say, why do you not honestly and frankly tell the House and the country that you have not the earnings and do not expect

them, and that you intend to add to the debt of the country by taking this money out of the treasury, out of which it must necessarily come ? That is the attitude these gentlemen would take if the government laid estimates on the Table for an expenditure in that way. So that you can see at once that if the road is to be improved, and improved promptly, and improved by the expenditure of a large amount of money, then of necessity we must borrow the money in order to do it; and when I say that we must borrow the money, I make the statement upon the assumption that there would not necessarily be in the treasury of the country a sufficient amount, after all the other charges for the government service have been disposed of, to meet this charge. If there should be such a surplus then there would be no addition to the debt, and you would be in exactly the same position as if you had voted the money on account of earnings, and had spent it out of such appropriation. I do not think it is humanly possible for any individual to construct any theory or to advance any argument to show, granting my basic proposition, that the expenditure must be made, that one farthing of difference has been made in the financial condition of the country, or that the people have lost one dollar by reason of the particular way in which it has been made, that is to say, by asking an appropriation on capital account.
I hope that my argument upon that point has been made clear. If it has, then there is no substantial ground for criticism as to the expenditure-I do not say as to some of the minute details. I am not going to affirm for a moment that in a large expenditure of millions there may not have been some items in which the expenditure has been larger than it would have been if a closer scrutiny had been kept. I make that statement so as not to appear to make too broad a claim. But in the main, considering these exceptions, I say that assuming that the expenditure was a proper expenditure, it could only be made in this way; and, so far as I can discover, there is no earthly difference between making it in this way and making it in any other way that can be suggested-except this :	The
ex-Minister of finance admitted what I am now stating. In the course of the discussions which have taken place on this question, he admitted that, as a matter of finance affecting the people of the country, or the treasury it did not make any difference ; but he said the difference comes in when we as a parliament are seeking to compare the character of your administration with the character of your predecessors'. The difference comes in, he said, when you want to put the two administrations side by side; you have expended sums of money out of capital which you might have spent instead out of any little surpluses you may have had, and have 108
therefore been able to show some little better results than you would have been able to do if you had followed the course pursued by your predecessors. Therefore, he said, for the purposes of comparison, the system of making the expenditure on capital account is not as defensible as the other system.
There is enough in that argument to justify one in taking a few moments of the time of the committee in order to examine it. You will observe that the proposition is based on two or three assumptions. You have to assume two or three things before you get the length of admitting that the argument is one of force or one that has any. application in the present case. You have to assume two or three very clear and explicit propositions, and I will tell you what they are. To be of any value for purposes of comparison, the first thing is that the conditions under which the comparison is to be made should be, if not absolutely identical, at all events approximately so. Is not that a fair argument to address to the committee ? Is it not fair to say that if you are going to make a comparison at all between this government and the last, then, for the purpose of supporting the statement that your expenditure has not been made under the proper heading, we have to show that the conditions of the expenditure during the period of the exMinister of Railways and the conditions during my period have been similar. Now, if you admit that, it will lead us into a moment's digression in order to see whether or not you can get the conditions alike by auy possible mode of straining or torturing of facts. I say you cannot. My hon. friend was pegging away on the Intercolonial Railway just sufficiently to keep it up so that it could run. No doubt the roadbed was good. There is no better roadbed in the country-solid and all that-very good as far it went. It was good for a locomotive of the size of 30 or 40 tons and to haul ISO or 200 tons, and to haul eight or nine cars at the outside. And if that was all right, my hon. friend was going along well enough. He was considerably out when we come to consider the question of economy, but economy was not sought for by my hon. friend. He took no practical method to secure economy. He was just peddling along in the same old way, and my hon. friend would have been content no doubt to have gone peddling along in the old way for fifty years if his government had only remained in office that long. But the country woke up, the country was aroused, and when I say the country, I mean the whole country. My hon. friend does not think probably that the maritime provinces, or even that portion of the province of Quebec which is traversed by the Intercolonial Railway is the country. But, supposing he is right in that view, I say that Ontario, which sends the largest part



of its traffic on the Intercolonial Railway clown to the maritime provinces-and everybody knows that Ontario furnishes us down there with almost all that we buy in the way of goods not manufactured in that country -is as deeply interested in the efficiency of the Intercolonial Railway as are the maritime provinces. There can be no doubt about that. And if my hon. friend were in my office and in receipt of the letters from the different manufacturers of Ontario which I daily receive, if he could read and hear their denunciations because we have not cars enough, or because we could not move freight and trains fast enough, and if my hon. friend from Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) could see these complaints, they would begin to think that there are other parts of Canada interested in the Intercolonial Railway outside of the maritime provinces and that portion of the province of Quebec which it traverses. Therefore, when I say the country, I mean the country as a whole, because the country as a whole is deeply interested. The conditions which existed when the country woke up and called for improvement on the Intercolonial Railway, were totally different from those which obtained during the years preceding. My hon. friend and his associates and colleagues, who have been attending the Public Accounts Committee, and spending no doubt sleepless nights in trying to figure out how many dollars were spent and how many tons of rails were laid down by the late government out of earnings, may take all the benefit they like out of the comparison. They will find that in no one year, during which my hon. friend (Mr. Haggart) administered the Intercolonial Railway, was there more than 3,000 to
5.000	tons of rails, laid down, whereas we have laid down 25,000 to 30,000 tons per year, and ought to lay down 50,000 tons per year, while the present generation or perhaps the children of the present generations are living, if we are ever to get the road properly equipped. I do not think there was any year in which my hon. friend put down as much as 5,000 tons of rails. In some years he put down 1,800 and in some 3,000 and in some 3,500. And there is no sense in making a comparison between an expenditure involving the laying down of 3,000 or 5,000 tons per year out of earnings and that involving the laying down of
25.000	to 30,000 tons per year. Are the conditions alike ? Can you put the one expenditure beside the other and draw any just or fair inference or make any just or fair comparison as between the two, in favour of my hou. friend's proposition ? I do not think you can.
But steel rails are not the only items. Take all the items right through. Take the item of new locomotives. We had to bestir ourselves, we had to be alive and try and accomplish something in our day. We had to buy 25 to 30 locomotives a year. We I Hon. Mr. BLAIR.
have not got them all yet, but are hoping to get them so that we will have them available for service during the year to come.

I do not think that if he were the bitterest opponent of mine, I should wish to have him suffer the grief which then appeared to weigh him down, but it did strike me with some surprise that he should have been so grief-stricken for the first time. It did appear father singular that he had not given some evidence of his extreme regret that such a policy should have been tolerated by the country, when the government which he himself supported did exactly the same thing, and did it under conditions which did not make it necessary, as they did in our ease, for his friends to take that course.

I recollect my hon. friend complaining about the treatment that men who went before that committee received at its hands.

When he has any to fire he fires them through somebody else. I want to tell my hon. friend what took place in that Railway Committee, and if he had been present I have no doubt that he would have had to be carried out on a stretcher. It appears that there was a circular issued by one of the officials of the Intercolonial Railway stating that the

mechanical superintendent of the road had condemned the locomotives which were in use upon the government railway. My hon. friend who was conducting the examination (Mr. Haggart) called a witness all the way from Moncton for the purpose of giving an account of himself and verifying the report in that circular. Of course the inference was that in condemning the locomotives, the mechanical superintendent had condemned those which had been recently purchased by my department in the United States. That is the idea these gentlemen no doubt had in their minds, and which they thought, by bringing the mechanical superintendent of the railway to testify they would be able to establish to the satisfaction of the committee. He came, and my hon. friend questioned him. And what facts did he elicit ? He elicited the fact that this circular was erroneous in that it quoted him as making a statement that he had not made. He had never condemned the locomotives, but had said that they required to be adjusted in some minor particulars in order that they might steam to the best advantage, and he attributed the delay in trains to the fact that they had not been sent to the shops as they ought to have been. He was asked by my hon. friend what locomotives he referred to, and gave the numbers. I think they were 24, 28, 66 and 68. My hon. friend asked where did 24 and 28 come from, and the answer was that they came from the Kingston works. And when were they got. In 1894. So, you see, so far as two of these locomotives were concerned, these hon. gentlemen were not able to show, as they had expected, that they were locomotives which had been improperly bought and which were inefficient in working and unfit for the service. Where did the others come from ? They came from the Cooke Locomotive Works in the United States. And when were they bought ? They were bought in 1893.

38098,ca.proc.d.1902-04-24.2.4.63,1902-04-24,intervention,,,,SUPPLY.,,,"Well, if the hon. gentleman is anxious that his certificate should be given as respects the character, quality and workmanship of the engines we are getting iu Canada, I will be only too glad, and l am sure the officers of the road will be only too glad, to give the highest certificate of their qualities. I have never hesitated to say in this parliament that the locomotives we got from Kingston always gave us great satisfaction, and in saying that, I am expressing the opinion of the officials of the road who are competent to pass an opinion upon that subject. And I have said chat we were only too sorry we could not get them all here.
Now I say that for the purpose of comparison it would be utterly absurd to complain of our charging expenditures of this character against capital, when they charged the expenditure of trivial amounts against capital, and where we are absolutely reconstructing the line in many important particulars; so that the force of the argument they resort to does not weigh in the present instance. It is in fact only a mere technical controversy ; the hon. gentlemen are chasing a shadow. The substantial fact is that the country has not suffered in the slightest, to the extent of u farthing, by reason of the way in which these expenditures have been charged. Has the country suffered under this administration as compared with their administration? I say no. To charge us up, as compared with their administration, with the millions we have spent in improving, renovating and recreating the road, would be an outrage upon all fairness, all reason, and all justice; therefore I entirely repudiate the force of the argument, and claim that there is nothing in it, and the country I think will be of that opinion also. Now there is a way in which a comparison can be made between this administration of the railway and their own, in which every element of justice and fair-play will be found, and by which they may obtain every advantage that possibly belongs to them. There are certain classes of expenditure which may properly come out of earnings year by year in order to keep up the standard of the road. Those are classified under a few heads and are very accessible. You can easily get at them, and you can easily see what is the gross amount of those expenditures. Now, take up the expenditures which are made for maintenance of way and works under the late government, and we find they expended in the gross, we will say, a million dollars. Now if I take the expenditures under this administration and show that under the same heads, for the same general purposes, we have expended less than they; or if they can show that they
have expended more than we, making allowance and charging up against us what would be a fair proportion for additional mileage, then they have got an argument. But if they cannot do that, they have not got an argument. They cannot show where we have expended less for those purposes, comparatively, than they expended, making allowance for the increased mileage ; then they cannot say that the comparison tells in their favour and does not tell in ours, or they cannot argue that we have taken out of capital money which we ought to have expended upon maintenance, in order to keep up the comparison and to make our position good as compared with theirs. I think I have made my proposition clear, and if so, then I will endeavour to elucidate it by the actual facts.
After all there are these different heads : Ways and works, which include all that is laid' upon the track, all that is laid out for improvements upon the stations, and all that is laid out for sidings, repairs to locomotives, and renewals of locomotives, repairs to cars and renewals of cars. These are the three heads under which the various amounts are found which have been laid out upon the road, and the fair comparison can be made from them. We can take these three items, these three general classes of expenditure by the late government, we go into them, we ascertain that they spent so much each year in respect to ways and works, so much in respect to repairs and renewals of locomotives, so much in respect to repairs and renewals of cars, we add these up and get year by year what they have laid out on the road. I do the same with the years of our administration. For the purposes of this comparison I have taken the last year of the late government. It is a fair year. They expended as much that year and rather more than in any previous year. It is a fair year for comparison, as I think my hon. friend will allow. I will take, of our administration, the years 1900 and 1901. I will compare their-last year with two years of our administration. The expenditure upon ways and works in 1896 was $774,556-the last year of the administration of the late government. The expenditure for the same purpose during the year 1900 was $962,978. For repairs to locomotives and renewals of locomotives in 1896 the expenditure was $230,000 in round numbers, and in 1900 it was $317,000. In 1896, for repairs to cars and renewals, the expenditure was $290,000, and in 1900 it was $472,500. Now, the total expenditure, therefore, of the late government for these three classes of work was $1,294,372. But we had more mileage than they. We had 15 per c.ent more mileage, we therefore had the earnings of 15 per cent more railway, and we are entitled to add 15 per cent to their outlay to put them on the same footing with us in 1900. If you will add 15 per cent to $1,294,372, you will find that it

amounts to $1,488,000. The gross expenditure by this department on the Intercolonial Railway in 1900, for these three purposes was $1,752,000. or $264,000 more when you add the additional mileage and percentage than was expended by the late government. Now, that $264,000 more was paid for the keeping up, repairing and improving of the road in its various departments out of earnings in 1900, and in the name of common sense is it possible for any hon. gentleman to construct the argument, or to support it, that we have taken money out of capital to do what they did in order to make a comparison with them ? Is it not an unmeasured fallacy ? Will it hold ground for a moment ? These are the facts and hon. gentlemen have the records and they can go through them. I do not deny that my hon. friend from Hamilton (Mr. Barker) can, as he no doubt will, pick out a few of the items which go to constitute these three classes of work, and make a long speech, and to those who are interested in minute details connected with railway expenditures, he can make an interesting speech. He can say, that, whereas the late government in some year, in any year that he chooses to select, spent $75,000 on one item, we have only spent $25,000. He' can do that in a hundred instances, or twenty or thirty instances, perhaps, and what is the value of it after it is done ?-Because to make a fair comparison, you must take the totals. The totals show that in the year 1900 the expenditure for all these purposes put together, taking the larger with the smaller and the smaller with the larger, by this government was $264,000 more than the expenditure in 1896, and that just so much more money was taken out of the earnings for the betterment, improvement and maintenance of the railway.
Now, I will ask to be allowed to make another comparison. I will give, for the benefit of my hon. friend, the result of the operation of the road in 1901, in which year we had a deficit of $488,000, and I will show what was spent for maintenance, ways and works, repairs to locomotives, renewals of locomotives, repairs to cars and renewals of cars. The late government spent in 1896, as I have already stated, for these purposes, $1,488,000, while we expended in 1901, under the same heads, $2,051,182, or $562,000 more, after adding 15 per cent for the additional mileage. More than half a million of money in excess was laid out on that road in these various departments, under these different heads, for the purposes which I have named, that is to say for betterment and improvement out of earnings. If we had not spent any more on the Intercolonial Railway for maintenance out of earnings than these hon. gentlemen did, making allowance for the additional mileage, we would have had a surplus of $80,000 instead of a deficit of $488,000. My hon. friend (Mr. Haggart) laughs. I do not know what the Horn Mr. BL UR.
laugh is indicative of. I would like to be able to interpret that laugh but he renders me no assistance. Does he laugh because he thinks the comparison of that kind is of no value ? Well then, if it is of no value, figures and accounts and statements are of no value. If the hon. gentleman thinks that figures are of no value then let him live up to his statement, because, if he does, he will have to hold his peace instead of offering any criticism upon the administration of the Intercolonial Railway. My hon. friend from Hamilton (Mr. Barker) would not like to subscribe to that, because, when he comes to make his speech, he will simply overwhelm us with statements of figures and calculations which will go to show, as he would say, that the comparisons were favourable to the late government and unfavourable to this government, but here are the figures which can be found in the public accounts and in the ' Hansard,' and they can all be criticised. Here are the figures as they are furnished by the department in the ordinary way, and they prove this, that if comparisons are of any value at all, if there is anything in the argument which hon. gentlemen make that we have taken money out of capital and spent it, which we ought to have taken out of earnings as they did, then that fact would appear on the record and would be evidenced by the results for that financial year. But, these things disprove any such inference, and absolutely nullify any such argument.
In connection with the question of capital expenditure, I must crave the indulgence of the committee, if I refer to another matter which I quite overlooked in the course of my digression for the benefit of my hon. friends opposite. I want to make this statement, and it is a somewhat important statement. The hon. gentlemen opposite who have been criticising the method we have pursued in charging expenditures to capital, wish us to understand that they never did such a thing when they were in 'office, and that therefore they are on strong ground when they now condemn this system. They would wish it to be inferred that their condemnation of the system was the result of their ripe experience in carrying out an entirely different system when they managed the affairs of the Intercolonial Railway. Well, Sir, even that ground, weak as it would be in view of the other arguments I have presented, is not available to my friends opposite. They cannot stand even on that narrow platform, because I will be able to show that they were equal sinners in that respect with us, if sinners we be. I will show that these very gentlemen, time after time, came to parliament and asked parliament to give them money on capital account for exactly the same purposes as we have spent money on capital account, and which they now condemn. Of course the expenditure was not exactly upon the same scale; I do not

If they asked for $100,000 on capital account, and if for similar purposes I ask $1,000,000, their position is not one whit stronger so far as the principle is concerned. They claim that in reference to this expenditure on capital, they are contending for a principle upon which they have lived, upon which they died, and to which they say we should adhere. Let us look at the records which are at our disposal. These records will afford some en-lightment to the House. I go back to the year 1891, and I find the Minister of Railways in the Conservative government asking parliament for capital expenditure for the construction of a ' Y ' at Truro, $1,500. Surely nobody will say that a ' Y ' at Truro was the introduction of something that was entirely so exceptional as to call for its payment out of capital account, if there is any reason at all in the argument now advanced by these gentlemen. Surely if they were justified in charging $1,500 for a ' Y ' to capital account, the cost of laying rails and of material for the equipment of a whole yard could be properly charged to capital account. Here are the expenditures for 1890-1 on capital account:

It will be noticed that there were even some
very small sums charged to capital account. I do not say that these gentlemen opposite were not justified upon the ground which I justify myself in asking for every one of these expenditures on capital. I am not condemning their expenditures. I never have, but I think it is rather more than human patience should be asked to stand to hear these gentlemen opposite venting their indignation and condemning in unmeasured terms my action when they themselves were the originators, and the adopters of exactly the same policy. If I were of opinion that they did wrong, I could not justify myself, but as I am strongly of the opinion that what they did in that respect was right, I think I may refer with some little confidence to their own record as in some degree tending to mitigate the wrath which they now pour out on my conduct, for doing the same thing as they did. In 1891-2, the Conservative government charged the following sums to capital account:

These are the items of 1891-2 on capital account expended by tbe Conservative government, and you would hardly credit it. To sit here patiently listening to the violent condemnation of these gentlemen upon me, you would hardly credit that they spent such sums on capital account. And mark you, that condemnation does not come from the men who simply sat by and zealously supported them in doing this, but it comes from the very men who>
did it themselves. It would almost try the patience of Job if he had to sit here and listen to such absurdities from these gentlemen opposite. Surely we are endowed with no ordinary quality of patience when we can sit here listening to the denunciations of these gentlemen. Surely we may congratulate ourselves on the patience exhibited by some of us, and by myself particularly. In 1892-3 these gentlemen spent the following sums on capital account:

You can judge how grave and serious was my hon. friend's conduct when I read to you the items which I propose to read now-the items of my hon. friend's last will and testament; the very estimates which the government of which he was a member prepared. to which they laid on the Table of parliament, which they struggled for many weary months to get the assent of parliament. and failed. If these estimates did not become the law of the land, it was through no fault of theirs. If they had become the law of the land, the expenditure would have gone on, and where would be the critics who are now condemning the expenditures ? If all that they have said in reference to our mode of making these expenditures is well founded, what must he the punishment of those who would initiate such outrageous expenditures as these ?

No wonder my hon. friend would like to take refuge in ignorance, because, while it is not a justification, it is the only excuse my hon. friend can offer. I am not able to yield even to the force of that as an excuse, because I cannot credit the possibility that these items could have been submitted to council, could have passed council, could have been laid on the Table, and yet my hon. friend, as the head of the department, which fathered them, could not have known of their existence.

My hon. friend may have forgotten for what purpose the particular rolling stock was bought, but he cannot forget, what was the fact, that it was not got for any extension of the Intercolonial Railway. It was got because they wanted that much rolling stock, and the only way they could get it was out of capital, because they could not hope to supply it out of earnings-exactly the same reason that has necessitated the same thing in the present case. Then my hon. friend proposed to expend $30,500 for increased accommodation at Moncton. Mind you, this is all right; I do not complain of any of these items, because there was no other way of doing the work. Then, he proposed to build a coal shed and trestle at Mulgrave at a cost of $500, and he gets the amount out of capital. Look at my hon. friend and say whether you think it possible that a gentleman who has taken the high ground that he has, who has stood so stoutly against this pernicious system which I have pursued, would come to parliament and ask for an appropriation of $500 out of capital account to build a coal shed and trestle at Mulgrave ? No; it must be a different gentleman. Some strange metamorphosis has taken place in my hon. friend since 1896. Then, here are some other items :
Extension to deep water at North

Increased accommodation at	Halifax..	105,000

1,500	00Improvements at	Little	Mens	
1,200	00Improvements at Sussex, Trenton and Orangeville	
850	00
I have read you the items of my hon. friend's own proposal. They do not total a million, but they do amount to $211,000, a substantial sum, sufficient at all events to afford very cogent evidence as to what he thought it would have been proper to ask parliament to do and for the government to do. This country cannot afford to listen to the charges, repeated ad nauseam, which these gentlemen are making about the expenditures on capital account, citing their long experience in support of their position, in the face of such statements as those and the facts shown by the public documents.

I am now going, Mr. Chairman, to pass on to a brief reference to the condition of things during the year for which the accounts are before us. The gross earnings were $4,972,235, as compared with our gross earnings in 1896 of $2,957,000. There was therefore an increase of 66 per cent in the gross earnings, as compared with 1896. Our working expenses last year were $5,320,000, showing a net loss of $348,000, to which we must add the rental upon the portion of the Grand Trunk Railway line that we use of $140,000, which makes a total of $488,000. Our gross earnings appear to have been increasing since the end of last year at the rate of about $400,000 per annum.
It is fair that I should give the committee an explanation of why the deficit for the last year was $488,000, when the year before we were able to show a substantial surplus of $120,000, and In making this statement I wish to call attention to the conditions and circumstances which existed last year, and which did not exist the year before or in years previous. In the first place, let me point out that, as compared with the year before, when we had a surplus of $120,000, we spent $300,000 more on maintenance of way and works. We spent $300,000 more under that bead. Therefore if we had only expended in 1901 the same amount which we did in 1900, when the mileage was exactly the same, if we had kept the road only up to the same standard, instead of $488,000, our deficit would only have been $188,000. I may say hex-e that when we made our arrangements for a very large portion of the expenditures on improvements, we did not anticipate the conditions which proved to exist, and that outlay was larger than it would otherwise have been. I am not saying that the outlay was not of value or that it does not tell. It does and will tell and was usefully made.
I know of no amount that has been expended which was not usefully expended, and which will not save expenditure this year. But on the Intercolonial Railway, as on all railways, you never reach the acme of perfection. If you think that you are going to have the money, you will make this thing a little better or improve that, and you will make this improvement in anticipation of your increased revenue. We did that last year expecting a good year. We did not have a surplus and in that sense did not have a good year, and therefore our expenditure on improvements was not kept so much within our control, or was not curtailed so much, as it would have been had we foreseen the conditions which proved to exist. We expected, in the first place, that we would have had a larger proportion of our large locomotives at work upon our road, and you can haul three times the amount of tonnage by one of these large locomotives than you can with the small ones. In consequence of our disappointment in this respect, the cost of operating the road was increased very materially. We counted

Mr. BLAIR.,Minister of Railways and Canals,SUPPLY.,843S,,"upon getting these locomotives, but the locomotive shops did not supply their locomotives as early as promised, and we did not have, by three or four big locomotives, the number that we thought would have been available to us for the year. I think I am entitled therefore to set down a considerable portion of the loss we suffered to that cause.
There were other causes also. Our coal last year cost us much more than the year before. In that respect we are in tiie same position as many other railways. If auy of you have followed the newspaper reports with reference to the net results obtained from the operating of railways in England, you will find that their dividends fell off very considerably. Some of these companies paid no dividends at all this year, and that they attribute almost entirely to the fact that the cost of coal had so materially increased. Some of our local roads here were more favourably situated because they had large contracts which had not run out. Take the Grand Trunk Railway, that company had a contract, which had been running some years, at very low prices for all the coal it required on that portion of its line which practically reaches half way to Toronto, but even that company, enjoying this advantage, called attention in its last report, to the shrinkage in profits owing to its increased expenditure on coal. Our condition, however, is entirely different. We make our contracts from year to year. We have not deemed it desirable or proper that such large contracts should be* made for a long term of years. Probably if we were to make contracts with the coal companies for a long term of years, and the time came when the price of coal, under that contract, would be very much below the market rates, we would have more trouble in enforcing our contract and getting our supplies than the whole thing would be worth. We therefore make our contracts from year to year, and last year we had to pay $3.30 per ton from the 1st July down to the end of the fiscal year. We asked for tenders in May, and I think about the 1st of July they came into effect. We therefore had to pay $3.30 per ton for a grade of coal which we got the previous year for $2.20. There is 50 per cent increase on the item of coal alone, or $1.10 per ton on the enormous quantity which we consumed on the Intercolonial Railway. We could not help ourselves, there was no remedy, we could not get the coal anywhere else at a lower price, and	we had to pay	this figure.
When you deduct the difference in the cost, you get a very large sum, and a sum which accounts for part of the deficit of the year. There was a difference of $1.10 a ton on the great bulk of the coal, there was a differen-ence of $1 on a portion, and a difference of 90 cents on another portion-keeping in mind always the quality of the article delivered. On the whole, I have counted the difference as $1 a ton. I had Mr. Pottinger

examine the statement carefully and give it to me accurately. And he states that the calculation of $1 a ton of increase is against myself rather than in my favour. There were 280,000 tons of coal which would mean that $280,000 more money was actually paid for the same quantity of coal than we paid the year before. We cannot increase our rates merely because an item of expense like this is increased. We would need a very large margin of profit in order to have as favourable a showing as we would desire to make. We cannot, I say, increase the rates, though, in some cases it would be quite reasonable. I did attempt it in one matter, and what occurred ? There was not a Conservative newspaper in the country that did not announce the fact with large head lines, declaring that I was attempting to impose upon the people.

And these gentlemen showed their desire to assist me in bringing about better results on the Intercolonial Railway in the manner I have mentioned. And not only that, but in newspaper editorials, and in public harangues, they tried to make the people believe that this was the policy entered upon, the object of which was to impose enormous additional burdens upon the people of the maritime provinces. So, you have $280,000 of this increased expense accounted for. Then, we paid increased wages to all our men-enginemen and firemen, conductors and train hands and all our trackmen. I am willing to submit to the committee the question whether or not I was justified in increasing the wages of the men employed on the Intercolonial Railway, even though it told in further diminishing a net surplus or in further increasing any deficit. We are prepared to take the responsibility of our action in that regard. We are paying our men something less-in some instances, considerably less-than men in the same class of employment are receiving on other railways. They claimed that they were entitled to equal consideration with other men. Our men are reasonable in their views. But we could hardly expect them to be satisfied with the showing that we had not earnings enough to enable us to pay wages that were paid on other railways. We could hardly expect them to yieid to the force of such an argument. They naturally replied that the government of the country surely cannot rely upon that as justification for asking men to work for less wages than they could get elsewhere, or for less than men in similar employment are receiving. I believe that there are no considerable number of hon. gentlemen in this House who are not desirous of doing the fullest and amplest justice to the employees on our railways and canals, and giving them the wages to which they are reasonably and fairly entitled. We know, as a matter of fact that, to a certain extent in all sections of the country and to a very considerable extent in some sections, there has been an increase in the cost of living. Labouring men in our towns and cities who used to work for $1 a day without any question, now get $1.25. And in some of our more prosperous cities, where the labour market is greater, the wages are even higher. We now pay our trackmen-and we have hundreds of them-$1.20 a day. They were getting $1.10 a day. I think we could afford to give them that increase. I believe that this country-this is how I feel myself, at all events, let the consequences be what they may-this country can afford to pay its employees reasonably well for their services. On the government railway we can afford to pay wages at least approximating the wages that men are getting on other railways under about the same conditions. And I may be asked to meet the views of the labouring men in the different departments to a greater extent than I have yet been able to yield to them. But the extent to which I have gone, moved by a sense of justice, imposed upon us last year $120,000 of expenditure in excess of the previous year. This is the increase of wages, let the committee note, paid to the same number of employees, for I am not speaking of the increase of wages due to the employment of a larger number of men during that period. But even with the increases that have been made the men are not getting unreasonable wages. I do not think the government could do better than to treat our employees fairly and justly both as to wages and to everything else. While I am dealing with this matter, I may mention a point which will tend to show the spirit with which we seek to meet the needs and the wishes of the employees of the railway. I have already, in effect, organized, as respects a large portion of the staff, a system of schedule employment under which youths come into the service and rise in grade as their merits justify, and as the years go by, with each rise receiving an increase in their pay. That schedule has been thought out very carefully, and I am happy to say that it is giving very general satisfaction among the employees of the road to which It applies. It has created very good feeling. I think it is most desirable, if it can reasonably be accomplished, that a good feeling should be maintained among our employees. And I think, I can say of the employees of the road that those who travel by our trains are unanimous in their expression of satisfaction at the kindness, the attention. the courtesy, with which our train hands treat them. I wish to pay that tribute to our men as a body. I Know of no exception. Commendation reaches me on

3447
all hands from people who are accustomed to travel on our road. They say that the attention they receive and the courtesy always exhibited by our employees compare favourably with that exhibited on other roads in the country.
Now we have adopted that schedule, and it has gone into operation in shops where we have hundreds of men employed. We are preparing schedules with regard to other classes of men employed, and one object I have in view is to secure permanency in the service. I want to see continuity; I want to see the men have something to look forward to, so that they can realize as years go by that their condition is improving up to a certain point-beyond which of course you cannot increase the wages of your men. We have fixed upon that point, it is satisfactory, and is not beyond what is being paid under the same conditions elsewhere. This has led to a feeling of contentment and satisfaction among the men. The fact that men are going in young and growing up in the service, and are able to see as time goes on, their condition improving, tends to make the service more lasting, and eliminates from it an element which has been very patent in times past, and which I think will not be evident hereafter. I mean that the men hereafter will not have to depend upon political pull in order to get an increase of wages, nor a set-up in the service, or a rise in grade. Each man now knows that he has to advance by regular and fixed progress, and when he goes into the service he knows that he cannot expect to rise over the heads of others, because he may have some friends who have influence with the powers that be. That is not fair, it is not just. I think we have eliminated that element from the service, so that when a young lad goes into the service he will go with the prospect of rising by his own merit, that he cannot hope to get any benefit from the intercession of any friends, and that he need not fear to suffer any detriment from the opposition of his opponents. He stands therefore in a fair position, and I think the service will be advantaged from that system.
Then we, are doing something more than that. I am planning a system by which the men, when they get to be advanced in years, and when they become unfit for real useful work, may retire upon a pension. 1 think we have practically reached an agreement by which we make a substantial contribution towards the fund, and the men make a substantial contribution towards it out of their own wages. They have a right to the tenure of the positions in which they are employed, by reason of thein contributions to this fund, and they get the full benefit from them. I believe a fine spirit will be brought into existence amongst the employees when these plans are in full operation, as X hope they will be before long.	<
I have been passing away from the items Hon. Mr. BLAIR.
of increases in order to mention what has been done in this direction, which I hope may not be without some Interest. You see, therefore, that when you add these items together, we expended $300,000 more during this year than we did last year upon maintenance and improvements of the road out of earnings. You see we paid $280,000 more for our coal than we would have paid if the price had been the same as it was the year before. You see we have increased the wages of our men by $120,000, on the same number of men ; we had on the whole therefore to provide for $700,000 more than we did the year before. We did that, Sir, as the result of the operation, and we have got a deficit of only $488,000. I am not ashamed of the result of the operation of last year ; on the contrary, a proper understanding of what has been achieved justifies me in claiming with some pride that we have come out very well. We have shown an enormous increase in our business, we have shown an enormous increase in our earnings; we have shown a betterment; we have shown an improved condition of the men; we have shown that although our outlay was upwards of $700,000 more than it was, the preceding year, we have a deficit of less than $500,000. Taking all these things into account, not considering these other matters at all-because they are not susceptible of being stated in dollars and cents, not considering the economies which must necessarily result in the future from the improvement in our methods and manner of equipment, not taking these things into account at all, but only the mere facts which I have related, the results have followed which I have just described.
I think, therefore, there is reason to look forward to better results during the present year, there is reason to look forward to better results in the future. I am not one of those who think that the Intercolonial Railway has either reached the limit of its progress, or that it has ceased to be an important factor in the business of this country. I have looked forward, and still look forward, to the time when there will be important extensions of the Intercolonial Railway. When we reached Montreal, that was regarded by me as the first step in the onward march of progress; but I do not think it ought to be the policy of the government in the future to stop there, but that when the proper time comes we should carry that road forward to another point westward, and then perhaps still further westward. I have always felt that when the time was ripe, one of the best things that could be done in the interest of this country, would be to extend that road from Montreal to the Georgian bay. I believe that the expenditure of a moderate amount of money upon the acquisition of that road, and upon doubling the track, if necessary, would put the people of this country in a position in which they could control a national route, national in every sense, be-

cause every foot of it would be in Canadian territory, national because it would carry those western products in the winter season as well as in the summer season to ports which lie on the Atlantic seaboard. 1 believe that with a line, double tracked if necessary, running from the ports of Halifax and St. John to Montreal, and thence in the neighbourhood of Ottawa through to the Georgian bay, we would be able to control a very large portion of the traffic of the western country by our own Canadian routes. Would not that be an object well worthy of the consideration of this parliament and of the country ? I am not going to say at this moment that the time is ripe for undertaking such a scheme, that is a matter about which there might well be a difference of opinion. Many persons think it is ripe; however, I do say that we are to keep it in view, and hold it before our minds as one of the things which time will bring to us, and which a sound and progressive policy will demand at our hands, by which we may conduct a great national highway as far west as we possibly can, to the advantage of the business of the country.
Now, Sir, I do not despair at all of the Intercolonial Railway. I denounce this attempt on the part of some to belittle it. I think it is unfair and unjust. I do not think that any man who wants to be fair to the institutions of the country-because it is one of them-or who wants to be fair to that portion of the country that it traverses, should deal with this subject in a sneering and contemptuous way. Why should the Intercolonial Railway be made a question of controversy between the political parties ? It is not a political road. It has not been a political road under the present administration. I say with all confidence that it has not been a political road in the sense in which the term is used. I am not going to make any pretense of saying anything more than I can properly say. I .am not going to make any pretense that if we have positions to fill and if we can get good men among our own friends we will not take them from among our own friends, but I am going to say, that, if we have good men on the road and that if we want good men on the road and we cannot get them from among our own friends, we will take them from among our opponents, and we will keep good men even though they may have been our political opponents. I dare say I am not preaching a doctrine that will commend itself to everybody, but it has been my endeavour since I have been in charge of this department to see that the Intercolonial Railway should be raised above the level of a purely political machine. I venture to say with all confidence that it cannot be successfully contradicted that I have done that since I have had the honour of being a member of this government. My hon. friends know, my friends as well as my
opponents, being familiar with the facts, what kind of a system it was that formerly obtained. They know that the Intercolonial Railway was available for party purposes in the interest of the friends of the late administration, and that when elections came on it was used to serve party purposes. They know that people in the employ of that railway who happened to be, or who were suspected of being in political sympathy with the Liberal party, were either prevented from having an opportunity of recording their votes, or by some means obstructed in the exercise of their franchise.
I know it and I know that political favours were given to persons who were travelling in the interest of the political party which was dominant at that day. There has been a rule adopted which I have rigidly endorsed upon the Intercolonial Railway ; I have said that if elections are going on anywhere on the line of the Intercolonial Railway, if favours are extended to one party they must be extended equally to both. I have never allowed passes to go out. I have absolutely prohibited the system which was in vogue before and which was a discredit to the Intercolonial Railway and to the country. They allowed these passes to be distributed in unlimited quantities, the evidence of which we have had presented to us, and one of the instruments for the dissemination of these passes by the late government was the gentleman whom the hon. member for South Lanark (Mr. Hag-gart) was anxious to introduce as a witness before the Public Accounts Committee. I have said that we have stopped this system and we have adopted a system of giving excursion rates. There are a great many people who want to vote to whom we give excursion rates, and these rates will be given to one party as well as to another. The fact that not one single whisper was heard from hon. gentlemen opposite after the elections which took place since this administration came into power affords the strongest possible proof of the truthfulness of what I say. There has been in this respect no criticism of the conduct of the Intercolonial Railway, or of its minister, or of its officials in that regard from the other side of the House since the time that I took charge of this railway, and which shows that we have enforced that rule with fairness to both parties. I found that the employees upon the Intercolonial Railway, as a matter of practice, train hands and others, were not allowed a chance to get away to vote under the former system. I ordered a reversal of that policy notwithstanding the fact that some of our friends complained. Not only that, but I gave an order that every facility should be accorded every man in the Intercolonial Railway service to go and vote at the election whether he was a Liberal or a Tory. In that respect I am bound to claim that I am right in making that statement by reason of the fact, to

which I referred a moment ago, that there was not a semblance of a complaint made [DOT]on the other side of the House as to any favoritism shown to one party or the other during the fight of 1900. Every man upon the Intercolonial Railway was left free to exercise his franchise as any man ought to be. I am not claiming any credit for it. I do not think it would be very worthy of any man who is administering a department if he knowingly allowed the contrary to take place. I do not accuse the hon. member for South Lanark (Mr. Haggart) of being a party to knowing that a system of political favouritism was going on. The fact is that every man on the road, Grit or Tory, during the last election had a free chance to cast his vote just as he pleased.
I think I have fairly shown, in view of all the necessities which have arisen that the estimates which we have asked parliament to support in times past in favour of this road have not been unreasonable, that they have been necessary and that they have not been in excess of what the actual necessities of the service require. I claim, that as respects the year just past, we have done, I think, admirably well in view of the fact that under all the adverse circumstances against which we have had to struggle, we kept the amount down to what it was last year; besides saying which we will be able to make some large improvements. I will conclude what I have to say to the committee by giving a statement of how the accounts stand down to the present moment, so that hon. gentlemen may draw their own inferences as to the balance for the year, or the eight months which cover the full period for which we are able to give the committee a satement. The working expenses were .$3,837,119 and the gross earnings were $3,700,859, showing that up to the end of February, or for eight months, or two-thirds of the year, we have a deficit of $136,000. Hon. gentlemen might assume that this is rather an unpromising outlook and that we may expect a deficit for the whole year, but let me call attention to the accounts for the same period of last year. I had hoped to have a statement for the same period of several years back, but it is substantially the same so far as the general principle or the inference is concerned which hon. gentlemen might be justified in drawing. Last year the gross earnings were $3,260,000 for identically the same period. Hon. gentlemen will observe that that is $440,000 less than the earnings this year. The working expenses were $3,917,662, rathe deficit to the end of February 1901 was $657,000 as against $136,000 this year. With a deficit of $657,000 we picked up last year until we reduced the deficit to $488,000, which would be about $175,000 of an improvement in the year. Well, if we make the same improvement this year-and I am inclined to think that we will make a better showing, but I cannot pledge myself posi-Hon. Mr. BTAIR.
tively to the statement-but if we make an equally good showing we will transfer what is now a deficit of $136,000 into a surplus of $40,000 or $50,000. I think, Sir, I am safe in saying that it will be somewhat better than that.

JOHN HAGGART (South Lanark).,,SUPPLY.,843S,,"Mr. Chairman ; at six o'clock the Minister of Railways finished his speech, which he commenced about three o'clock, in reference to the Intercolonial Railway. I presume that he assigned some reason, in my absence from the Chamber for a few moments, for confining his discussion entirely to the Intercolonial Railway, and at some future time I suppose we will have a discussion upon transportation, and upon the canal system of Canada. Following the example of the minister, I shall confine my observations to a discussion of the Intercolonial Railway and its management from 1897 down to the present. When I left the department, in 1896, I thought I left the Intercolonial Railway in as good a state of efficiency as was possible. I thought the rolling stock was in good order, and that the roadbed was perhaps the best of any railway in Canada. I had the gratification of receiving reports, after I left office, from the managers and chief engineers of that road, telling me of its efficiency, and giving me a creditable account as to the rolling stock and everything appertaining to the railway. The Minister of Railways (Hon. Mr. Blair) prides himself on comparisons, and he puts himself on a pedestal almost too high for us sublunaries to worship at. His comparison between my management of the Intercolonial Railway and his is nevertheless somewhat ridiculous. To listen to him to-day one would think that no railway manager on the face of the globe could be more efficient than he, and that none could have more neglected the road than I did when I was minister. I left the department when the Intercolonial Railway was comparatively a small road of 700 or 800 miles, but since then, on account of the acquisition of the Drummond County Railway and other extensions, it has been increased in importance. Fortunately we have good memories. We remember the glowing terms in which the minister described to this House the advantages that would be derived from the extension of the Intercolonial Railway to Montreal. The Minister of Railways, like his right hon. leader, found that the Intercolonial Railway ended in a bog opposite Quebec, and they proposed to make its terminal in the great city of Montreal. But the Minister of Railways is not satisfied even yet. He sees a grand future for government railways in this country. He sees the day not far distant when the Intercolonial will reach out to the Georgian Bay,

and when later on we will have a government system of railways extending not only from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes, but on to the Pacific ocean. The Minister of Railways has grand views for the future, but let us examine for a moment his management of the comparatively small line of railway which is at present under his charge. In 1897 the hon. gentleman made this statement to the House :
Again we are told that we are adding to the public debt by this proposal. So we have been reading in the newspapers which are published in the interests of our hon. friends opposite. And so we have heard from my hon. friend the leader of the opposition. They have told us that we are adding $7,000,000 or $8,000,000 to the public debt by this proposal. A little consideration will convince anybody that there is no ground at all for that statement. I entirely and absolutely repudiate the soundness of any sueh claim. You might just as well charge a merchant who happens to think that it would be an advantage to his business if he were to remove his store from a back street to a front street, with having added $8,000 or $10,000 to his liabilities, because he has agreed to pay an increased rent of $300 or $400 a year. These gentlemen say: You are adding to the public debt. I deny it. You are entering into an arrangement, which, I will show you, as far as our foresight and the judgment and experience of the men who have been operating the Intercolonial and are responsible for it, are able to assure us, will enable us t'o pay every dollar of rental we have engaged to pay, and have a surplus besides. Is it possible that these gentlemen can say that we cannot increase the business of the Intercolonial by getting into Montreal ? Is it possible for them to make the statement, against the experience of railway operations and of business men the world over, that we cannot hope for an increase in the earnings of this road, and cannot hope to pay any portion of the rental we are incurring by means of the earnings upon this additional mileage, over and above the expenses of working and so extinguish the debt which the hon. gentleman says is being incurred under the proposal of the government ? We shall not add $1 to the public debt, unless we fail, by the operation of the railway under the conditions agreed upon, to pay the rental we have engaged to pay upon acquiring these roads. If we fail in that, then, having engaged to pay this rental for 99 years, we shall certainly be assuming what will be equivalent to an addition to the public debt. No man can say with absolute certainty wliat will be the result ; we cannot demonstrate it with geometrical positiveness, but we can form a judgment upon it, we can take the experience of business men, we can learn from -ihe experience of other railways, and draw a fair business conclusion. And if the conclusion that we arrive at is that these new roads acquired under the conditions proposed, will enable us to pay the rental, and that conclusion is justified by experience, we are incurring no debt, and the charge made by hon. gentlemen opposite is an assumption, and has1 no solid ground upon which to rest.
And so on, the hon. gentleman led the House to believe that the country was virtually incurring no fresh debt by purchasing the Drummond County Railway and acquiring the entry into the city of Montreal. The
facts are against him, as I will soon show. His purpose was, he said, to put life into the old concern, to make it a going and prosperous business, to show what the energy and ability of a man of business could do in the management of a concern that was put under his control. You would have thought that the hon. gentleman had beeu a railroad expert from his birth up. He is good at declamation ; he is good at making statements and promises, hut none of them ever pan out. Nothing he promises to the people of this country is ever fulfilled. All his promises in reference to the Intercolonial Railway have proved to be nice to the ear, so far as his supporters are concerned, but false when they come to be examined. What was the hon. gentleman's object in bringing the Intercolonial Railway into the city of Montreal ? His object was, as I will show from his speech in the city of St. John, to provide a competitor for the through traffic from the west to the city of St. John and the city of Halifax. That was his reason for asking for these enormous sums-for the purpose, as he alleged, of putting the Intercolonial Railway into good order, and acquiring rolling stock, which to a great extent he finds he cannot use on the road. That was the reason he expended over SLOCK),000 at St. John and a large sum at Halifax for increased terminal facilities. Any sane man knew that to enter into competition with the Grand Trunk Railway in carrying through freight to the seaboard, or with the Canadian Pacific Railway, which carried it a much shorter distance to St. John, was altogether out of the question. The hon. gentleman took that upon himself ; lie did it off his own bat ; for, according to the evidence of the chief engineer of his department, the chief engineer did not believe that it was possible to accomplish the object. He has shown that we could not accomplish it. Where are the large quantities of grain flowing out of the Intercolonial elevator at St. John ? What has become of the through traffic that was to he carried to that city ? Let us judge of it by the words of his own paper down there to the effect-I will not read the article, because it is too long-that although he lias not been able to accomplish his object, he has been able to make an arrangement with the Canadian Pacific Railway by which they maintain their traffic to St. John. What has become of the hon. gentleman's denunciations in which he said that no one but a stupid, a fool or a knave would enter into the arrangement which existed between the Intercolonial Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway ? He was hound to put an end to that arrangement. Did he put an end to it ?

Hon. air. HAGGART. You are without through traffic ; you have no oceanbound traffic, though it is increasing year by year. If the traffic of the Intercolonial Railway has increased at all, it is on account of the prosperity of the country in which the Intercolonial Railway is located, particularly on account of the development of the mines and mining industries at Sydney and elsewhere. What we told him has turned out to be perfectly true. The idea of a government entering into competition with two lines of railway which had their termini at Point LCvis, and whose interest it was to pick up freight all through Ontario and the west for the purpose of furnishing traffic to the Intercolonial Railway. He was to come to Montreal and cut them out of that business. He expected to get through traffic, but where did he expect it to come from ? From the Canadian Pacific Railway ? He could not get it from them ; they had a road to St. John themselves. From the Grand Trunk Railway ? They had their own road to Portland. Who was to furnish it to him? The Canada Atlantic. They did furnish a few loads of grain which he carried from the Georgian Bay down to St. John at 6 cents a bushel, the greater portion of which was paid to the Canada Atlantic for their part of the traffic. He carried from Montreal to St. John for the purpose of carrying out the promise which he had given to the people of this country, a few loads of through freight. But we are going to have a bridge over the St. Lawrence at Quebec ; we are going to have communication with that great system of railways to be built from Quebec to connect with the Mackenzie and Mann system, and that system will have the outlet the hon. gentleman desires. But this country is furnishing locomotives, is strengthening the road and doing everything else long precedent to anything that may possibly occur to warrant this expenditure.
When the hon. gentleman got the House to sanction the purchase of the Drummond County road, he told us that he would not touch it if it was not up to the standard of the Intercolonial Railway. But I find that nearly $200,000 have been spent on it for Hon. Mr. HAGGART.
the purpose of keeping it in repair, and 1 drew out the statement from the hon. gentleman that before locomotives of this size which he uses on the Intercolonial Railway between Point Levis and Montreal can be used on the Drummond line, he has to build new bridges on that whole section of railway. And this, notwithstanding the sworn statement of his officers before the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, that the steel bridges, which were newly put down on the Drummond Railway line, were up to all the requirements of the Intercolonial Railway. The minister excused himself by saying that he has changed his mind as to what the requirements of the Intercolonial Railway are, and has decided that that road shall be up to the standard of modern railways, that it shall be equipped with large locomotives and freight cars and heavy rails and bridges which to sustain them. He tells us that the gradients of the road are heavy. But why is it that such expenditure is required ? The only possible excuse is that he wants to use it as a through line, for the local trade could be better served with the locomotives and bridges, and the material that were on the Intercolonial Railway when he took office than with the heavy rolling stock he is putting on at present. The hon. gentleman expected to make this road a magnificent through road, and for the purpose of carrying out that scheme of his, in competition with the different railways, and building up an ocean-bound traffic through this country over the Intercolonial Railway, [DOT]which would take its departure from St. John and Halifax, he entered on this lavish expenditure, but he has found out that he could not do it.
Why did he buy his locomotives before his road was ready for them ? Can any man in his senses explain that ? From 1807 up to the present, he has bought over eighty-five heavy locomotives, as the return shows, and after buying these, he proceeded to make his bridges able to bear them. He puts on rails which can carry these locomotives, and he orders these rails and these locomotives immediately before the election. 1 heard the hon. gentleman express his surprise at the corruption of his predecessors. We heard him tell us that he did not follow the precedents of his predecessors. That he never gave tickets to parties going to vote or prevent them from going to vote as they chose. Did any of his predecessors ever prevent a man from voting or ever influence him in any manner against voting as he thought proper ?

Mr. HAGGART.,,SUPPLY.,843S,,"No, Sir, no corruption was ever used by the late government for the purpose of influencing the electorate. But we cannot say the same of the hon. gentleman. He let out large contracts immediately before the election. He supplied the capital and everything else necessary for the purpose of starting locomotive works

in Kingston and thus getting his candidate elected. He bought 1,250,000 ties for the Intercolonial Railway when there were only 500,000 ever used and the balance is still on hand. He could write notes himself to the contractors to hand to the inspector, instructing the inspector to pass the ties, though they were not up to the standard of inspection. He got the inspector to pass these ties just the same as if they were what the contract called for. There were 800,000 ties more than were required, but he did not care, nor did he care what kind they were. He had them accepted, although not up to the specification at all. According to the return, we find that nearly one-third of them were not up to the specifications, yet they were taken and paid for. Black spruce ties wej;e required under the contract, and white spruce were accepted and paid for, and it is geuer ally reported that the payments are in excess of the quantity delivered. There is one naked ancl bald fact which stands out clearly. It is this, that these ties were delivered in May last, and have not all been inspected up to the present and counted. That fact stands out lioldy and plainly, that ties, which were delivered in May last, have not been inspected and counted up to the present. That was the evidence of Mr. Pottinger on the subject, and this is the gentleman who talks about the corruption of his predecessors, who charges them with having corrupted the electorate, who grows eloquent on the servile crowd that was following his opponents. But besides all that, the hon. gentleman poses as a sage. He not only knows the past and the present, but, like that other great Grecian, he the future knew. While he lived or while I live, he says, there is no prospect of the Conservative party returning to power in this country. That is the hon. gentleman's Idea. But I hope that the people of my country have not become so debased, so servile, so debauched, so corrupt, that when they come to understand the position of affairs, when they come to realize how their money has been lavishly and foolishly expended for the purpose of corrupting constituencies, they will not turn the present government out of power. What other reason than corruption could there be for giving a man a price for steel rails over the price he tendered at ? What other purpose could there be for breaking into the time-honoured manner in which contracts were formerly let on the Intercolonial Railway by awarding them as was done in Kingston? Fancy a government assisting a company by advancing it the full extent of money necessary for the purpose of starting and carrying on its business. Sums were advanced on what are called ' progress estimates ' on the material to be supplied to the government. Who judges the progress estimates ? A Mr. Davis, who was not then ' an officer though he may now be on the Intercolonial Railway. We all knew him as an officer of the North Shore Railway 109
some time ago until it entered into the hands of the Canadian Pacific Railway. We knew him at a later date In the employ of the city of Montreal for some engineering purposes. But now, with the experience he has gained in these places, and being considered a fit person for the purposes of the Intercolonial Railway, he is sent to pass these locomotives in the city of Kingston, and also the supplies that came with the Intercolonial Railway locomotives.
The hon. gentleman was amusing when he spoke of my criticising his purchase of locomotives in the United States. Perhaps he referred to what my colleague said. I never criticised him for having gone to the United States. My idea is this, we afford a protective duty to encourage manufactures in this country, and having afforded them that protection, we have a perfect right to purchase in the United States if we cannot do as well here. If the hon. gentleman could get better locomotives at that price in the United States, I do not blame him. I do not know that he could have purchased them anywhere else at the time. But as to the charge against me of buying them from the United States, I heard the evidence before the committee the other day, when one witness said that one of these locomotives was purchased in 1893. That may have been before my time. Here is the evidence which the hon. gentleman (Mr. Blair) disputed :

The whole question was a paltry one, so far as the interests of the country are concerned. The money comes out of the pockets of the people however it may be charged. But, for the purposes of a fair comparison between my record on the Intercolonial Railway and the record of the present minister, I want to see tlie books kept in the same form as that in which I kept them.

The original rails and plates, and fastenings, for the 760 miles weighed 69,160 tons per mile. Although the above figures show a betterment of about
15.000	tons in actual weight of metal in the track, no additional charge was made against capital account, but revenue had to bear the whole cost. The Minister of Railways and Canals now proposes to replace those 67 pound rails with a heavier rail and heavier fastenings, weighing 80 pounds per yard, and the fish plates 110 pounds.

This shows a betterment of about
17.000	tons against only about 15,000 tons between the original 56 and 67 pound rails. Capital instead of revenue has now to meet this charge ; and so it goes on in the estimates. My point is that when we renewed

and replaced the old rails on the Intercolonial Railway we charged them to revenue account. The hon. Minister of Railways and Canals, who is at present renewing the rails, charges them to capital account and when he makes the statement about the snail's pace at which we proceeded with the renewal of rails I will tell him that we laid 80 miles in one year.

We have been at some pains to refer to the old reports for six years previous to 1890, and find there is not a record of a dollar of this' expenditure having been charged to capital.

That I have already read. Then it continues :
That there can be no mistake about it, we quote from the general manager's own report of 1886. After describing in detail the large improvements, such, as sidings, new stations, four iron bridges, five new water tanks, 159 cars, two locomotives

Has the hon. gentleman fullilled a single promise he made in reference to it ? Well, the hon. gentleman is going to branch out. He is going to extend the Intercolonial Railway up into the Georgian Bay. He hopes at some future date to reach the North-west. I wonder is it in the syndicate of the hon. gentleman s friends wiio are trying to negotiate the sale of the Intercolonial Railway, at the present moment in New York city. Is it under the auspices of the Dominion Securities Company ? I suppose the hon. minister has heard of that for the first time. It may be amusing and interesting for the House to know all about this concern. I did not know that the hon. gentleman intended to acquire the Intercolonial Railway.

Mr. HAGGART.,,SUPPLY.,843S,,"I know nothing about it except the circular that is published by this company, which has an excellent standing before the whole world, as great as Bradstreet and others have in this country. Here is another circular issued by that company :
Dominion Securities Company, opposite Grand Central Station, 51 East 44th street, New York city (organized under the laws of the state of New Jersey), has a charter similar to the Har-riman charter, enabling it to deal in stocks, bonds and securities of all kinds, and to loan money on the same, &c.
The company has acquired the franchises, rights of way, concessions and subsidies which the Dominion of Canada, and also the province of Nova Scotia, grant upon fulfilment of its undertaking to extend the Nova Scotia system of railways, under which it is estimated that 600 to 800 miles of railroad will be built within the next four years.
They made a nice arrangement, they intended to secure this railway bonus and the committee themselves have secured a Hon. Mr. HAGGART.
majority of the stock in the contracting company, the object of which will be seen later :
The company has now 48 per cent of the capital stock of the Manhattan Contracting Company, 95 per cent of the capital stock of the Cape Breton Extension Company, and also $2,400,000 bonds of said company and assignment of the Nova Scotia government's subsidy for the building of the Cape Breton Railroad, as the first of a series of concessions, franchises, &c., receivable on account of the construction of railroads interlacing the province of Nova Scotia; all subsidies and grants, &c., by enactment of the House of parliament, as fixed under the laws of the government, together with the whole capital stock, bonds and benefits going direct to the Dominion Securities Company.
I want the Minister of Railways to listen to this part of the Subsidy Act in which he gives half of the amount to the different railway companies when the cost is in excess of $15,000 per mile :
The cash subsidies granted by the Dominion of Canada and the province of Nova Scotia are ?6,400 cash per mile. Land grants and other inducements of the governments increase this
about $1,600 additional per mile. The government permits and authorizes the issue of bonds upon this railroad construction as follows :
Per mile.
First mortgage bonds	$15,000
Second mortgage bonds	 5,000
Total mortgages	$20,000
Of which the Nova Scotia government agrees to take and pay for at par $10,000 per mile of the above first mortgage bonds.
In addition, the government agrees to advance one-half of the cost of building the railroad in excess of $15,000 per mile, up to an excess of $6,400 per mile. Thus, for example, upon railroad costing $18,000 per mile, the government will pay an additional $1,500 cash per mile, i.e., one-half of the $3,000 per mile in excess of the $15,000 per mile', cost of construction as well as all of the $6,400 cash per mile, already provided for. The Dominion of Canada and Nova Scotia governments pay a cash subsidy per mile of $6,400.
Why do they state in the prospectus that they have secured arrangements with the Manhattan Construction Company for the purpose of building the road ?

The Dominion Securities Company holds control of stocks of various companies which have been consolidated with the St. Lawrence and Adirondack into a trunk line of railroad from the lakes to the Atlantic, together with other franchises, of immense value, including an annual subsidy of 5 per cent on the entire capitalization, in perpetuity, as soon as connecting links of road are completed, work upon which will begin as soon as the winter breaks.
Here is a circular issued to his friends and the general public by this same man and calling attention to his stock manipulations and what a good hand he is at that business :
My reason for calling your attention to my new enterprise is the fact that my purchases and stock manipulations of recently acquired railroad properties have proven so successful I desire to extend my field of operations, and want the co-operation of a large clientele.
My first venture was that of the St. Lawrence and Adirondack Railroad. This stock I advised purchasing at a round $57 per share. My friends heeded the advice, and to-day the stock is lisicd on the New York stock exchange, is selling at $135 a share, is considered a gilt-edged security, and pays 5 per cent dividend.
My next venture was in Dominion securities. This company has a subsidy from the Canadian government equal to 5 per cent in perpetuity on its capital stock. . . .
My object in quoting the above is this ; The firm of Theodore S.

Nova Scotia Railways.

 Attorney General Longley, acting premier of Nova Scotia, being interviewed in Halifax regarding the story that New York millionaires were about to engage extensively in railway enterprise in that quarter, is quoted as saying :
The names mentioned look really heavier than they are. It is doubtful if John J. Astor is a director, and the connection of the Vanderbilts with the scheme is very faint, even supposing the report to be correct. Dr. W. Seward Webb is a connection of the Vanderbilts by marriage, but is not very much more than a figure head, so far as being a factor in railroad manipulation is concerned. There is a proposal before the government at the present time to build a small railroad in the eastern part of the province, and that is the only one of which the government has cognizance. The proposition before the government is one to build a railroad from the Strait of Canso to Louisburg, with a branch to Sydney. It is from the company known as tho Cape Breton Railroad Extension Company, which obtained a charter in 1899, and was composed of the following : Lorenzo Shute, New York ; Joseph Shute, Atlantic City ; John Crump, superintendent of docks. New York, and others. The proposal to build this road is being pushed by Edward Guerin. Montreal, who probably obtained his charter from the above.
Then there is a statement in contradiction to that from Meyer & Co., to Dow & Co.

My informant goes so far as to state that he doubts very much the truth of the assertions. He doubts very much the power of Mr. Pugsley who is down there conducting negotiations, to make any conveyance of the kind. He states that the opinion was given by Mr. Blair after visiting New York, that there was such opposition to any proposition of that kind from both Conservatives and Reformers that it would be almost impossible to carry it through. But still Mr. Pugsley is negotia-

ting. However, my informant wrote me to this effect, that it is possible that one of the branches of the Intercolonial Railway not being of any use to that railway, might be signed over to the company when they formed their connection with the Canada Atlantic and secured the southern road- and I notice that they succeeded in accomplishing something in the way of expedition which was never known in the legislation of this country before. They introduced a Bill in the New Brunswick legislature. The same day it was introduced it passed the committee stage, got its second reading in about two hours-in connection with the same firm, which are financing it, and they intend, it is alleged, to build a railway from the state of New York for the purpose of connecting with this line. There is a grand future before it. The lion. Minister of Railways and Canals will have to be on the alert if he is going to have the Canada Atlantic Railway part and portion of that grand scheme of his from Lake Superior to Depot Harbour. I am afraid Mr. Meyer has got ahead of him. I am afraid that Mr. Webb and the Dominion Securities have made the purchase, and it surely will not do for the government of Canada- although they did it already-by assisting a competitive line from Point Lfivis to Montreal where there were two roads already in existence-to put money into an undertaking for the purpose of destroying capital which is already invested.
I have not gone into details with reference to the Intercolonial Railway. We shall have an opportunity to discuss the various items as they come up, and of getting the fullest information concerning them from the minister. What I have sought to do is to draw the attention of the country to the enormous sums of money that have been expended on that road. What the people of Canada promised the people of the maritime provinces when they came into Confederation was this-to build the Intercolonial Railway and to make it a good, efficient connection between these upper provinces and the maritime provinces. We contributed cheerfully to the building of that road, and what we expected from our officers in administering it was to keep it in a state of efficiency equal to that of any road in America. We thought we did it. We fixed the tolls at rates which would not be remunerative, though a different course could have been adopted had we desired, for 1 state upon my authority as one who has had control of that road, that by charging the freight rates which are paid by the people in other portions of this Dominion, it would have been as easy to cause that road to contribute a million dollars a year to the revenues of this country as to sink three or four millions a year by the rates which were adopted. But we said :	We will not exact the uttermost
farthing, and so we gave them the cheapest
transportation enjoyed by the people in any part of the Dominion. But we have right to say-and this is what we expected at Confederation-You have the road, now let no expenditure be made upon it beyond what will be covered by the receipts of the road itself. That would be only just nnd fair to the rest of this Dominion. It may be said that we of the upper provinces are participants in the benefits of the road. It is true that, to a large extent, we are participants, but mainly it is for the benefit of the people of the maritime provinces. And the people of the maritime provinces should not support a minister who makes it his policy to get ns much ns possible out of the funds of this country for the purpose of expending it in those provinces, buying stations at St. John, building elevators here and there, when any man who knows anything of the commerce of this country knows that not a bushel of grain can be profitably exported by the Intercolonial Railway

But, if you wish to make tbe Intercolonial Railway a live road, and one that will be useful, make it tbe means of reaching the port that is the nearest to Europe, and so make the road the link in the chain of communication between Canada and Great Britain. Start a fast line of steamers, with Sydney or Louisburg as the port on this side. In choosing your port, pay no attention to local politics or to anything else except the interests of the whole country. So far as I know, the question would be between Louisburg and Sydney. Then, keep your road up to a high state of efficiency, connecting with other railways in Canada and the United States. In this way you will develop the traffic that will be most advantageous in many ways, and you will have a road that will do more for the maritime provinces than all the schemes of through freight and building of elevators and other absurdities that a Minister of Railways is often urged to go into. The people will have this. As I said before, they are not so servile, so corrupt, so debauched that they will support a government in expenditures which are needless. By the course we are now pursuing, we are simply flinging immense sums of money into a sink-hole-these expenditures are of no benefit to the country whatever. This idea of developing the Intercolonial Railway as a heavy freight line, providing heavy locomotives, and then making heavy tracks and strong bridges to bear them, is an absurdity. The road can never have the heavy, long freight trains of a western road, and these new locomotives are not as suitable for traffic upon the road as were those the road already had.
The necessity to put the old road in a good style ! He says 83 locomotives of this large size within the last number of years are not sufficient to carry on the increased traffic of the Intercolonial Railway. But they have plenty to spare, they loaned 11 of them the other day to the Canadian Pacific Railway. The excuse was that the mechanical engineer said they were not fit for the use of the Intercolonial Railway. To have a railroad up to the standard you must have locomotives burning a minimum of coal with a maximum of power. You can get a good 500 horse power engine and run it with the same cost as a 150 horse power engine. Where is this traffic for which they want a 500 horse power engine, with a long train of 40 or 50 cars, unless it is from some coal mine to some port near by ? There Is nothing of the kind required. The Minister of Railways and Canals has made a statement concerning his administration of the Intercolonial Railway, which railroad men, when they read it, from one end of the country to the other will laugh at. It is a perfect farce. Look at the amount expended. What is the necessity of the increased expenditure on the Intercolonial Railway ? In Hon. Mr. FIELDING.
every department there is an increase. Let me give a few instances for the Minister of Railways and Canals. Compare the paylists and extra wages this year and last year. In 1900 the pay-list and extra wages for the Intercolonial Railway amounted to $2,700,023.71. In 1901 the expenditure on the same account was $3,403,645.92, or an increase of $697,612.21. Can there be a possible justification for that ? Now the expenditure in the Moncton office, in 1900, was $132,531.21 ; in 1901, it was $178,118. Expenditure on offices outside of Moncton, in 1900, $27,949.58 ; in 1901, $32,656.48. Car shops. Moncton, the expenditure increased from $121,000 in 1900 to $131,000 in 1901. In locomotive shops, the increase is from $145,000 to $163,000.
The hon. gentleman talks about the efficiency of the road, about the esprit de corps that he is building up. He says that no man should be dismissed on account of his political opinions, that a young man can go into the employ of the Intercolonial Railway and work up, and his position cannot be taken from him by any means. He talks about providing a retiring allowance, and everything else. But the Minister of Finance will please look at the enormous increased expenditure in 1900 just before the election. What a commentary it is upon the statement of the Minister of Railways and Canals in reference to his non-interference with political affairs during the election. I listened to him, and thought possibly that I was mistaken in my understanding of what he said. When I heard those words of wisdom and honesty coming from the hon. gentleman I was astonished. I said to myself, is it possible that an hon. gentleman who can speak in this manner has been guilty of such acts as were laid to his charge ? One would hardly believe it. It reminds us of Shaks-pere's saying, ' Methinks she does protest too much.' Whenever you hear the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals speaking on behalf of virtue, begin to suspect him.
I think perhaps, Mr. Chairman, I have said enough at present. I may have an opportunity of referring to this subject again. I want to speak on the trans-Atlantic service and on the question of transportation, and I may have an opportunity of doing so on some of the canal estimates. But as concerning my administration of the Intercolonial Railway, I think it will compare very favourably with the administration of the hon. gentleman. I am confident the country from one end to the other will be able to judge on which side economy was practiced, on which side there was an honest and efficient administration.

As I heard it read, and as 1 read it some weeks ago, it relates entirely to rail-

ways in Nova Scotia. Whatever may happen with railways in other parts of the Dominion, there are not many railway enterprises projected in Nova Scotia that are not brought to my notice in one form or another by gentlemen who come round looking for my interest in the matter. I am bound to say that I never heard from the Dominion Securities Corporation, or any people in connection with them, regarding this great railway enterprise which appears in this circular. I think the issue of that circular, if it was issued by any respectable broker, is a disreputable transaction, and if Dr. Seward Webb permitted the use of his name in the way it is used there, I certainly think he has not given a very strong reason why we should regard him with favour in any railway enterprise in Canada. Of course his name may be used without his authority.

But I say the issue of that circular is something which should not come from any broker of good repute. I say there is nothing in the relations between the Dominion government and that company, and I believe I can go further and say that there is nothing in the relations between the Nova Scotia government and that company, which justifies that circular or anything like it.

Mi-. OSLER. Some of the duplicate circulars that have been referred to have been received by me at my office in Toronto. 1 have had circulars from Mr. Meyer. I do not know him, and I never heard of him until I received a circular. I have had circulars and letters advising the purchase of Dominion Securities stock. At first the stock was quoted at about 92. These were the ordinary circulars sent out from brokers offices in New York. A later circular quoted the stock as having advanced to 105, and later on a circular was received, not personally by me, but in the course of business by my firm, again advising purchase and stating that the stock had gone to 115 or 120. I do not know anything about this matter except from the circulars I have received. But the impression that these circulars left upon my mind was that the New York speculators, seeing the reckless manner in which bonuses fire given by the different provinces of this country, and by the Dominion itself, have concluded that Canada is an easy and profitable mine to work, and that they may be able to float wildcat and visionary schemes. But, evidently, the statements contained in the prospectus that has been read are statements that are believed by men who stand very high in the city of New York.

These circulars are sent out by reputable houses in New York. The firm of Dow, Jones & Company are to my knowledge a very reputable firm. There can be only one conclusion drawn from this series of circulars, and it is that the Dominion government and the provincial government are looked upon as absolutely soft and ready to be bled, so soft that these people are able to publish the statement that they believe will not go uncontradicted, that they believe will not cause their contracts to be cancelled, saying that the province of Nova Scotia and the Dominion government will grant sub-

sidies, which will net them a profit of $G,-000,000 over and above the whole cost of the railway. In that circular, which has been issued under the authority of Dr. Webb, Mr. Astor, and other well known men, they say that they have made a contract with the governments here that will net them from $5,000 to $0,000 a mile over and above what the engineers estimate the cost of the railway. The only inference I draw from that is that both the Dominion and local governments ought seriously to look into the policy of granting bonuses to railways that are simply being built for speculative purposes, granting bonuses to railways* which are of no general benefit, but which are being used for local purposes, granting bonuses to railways which are absorbed by one or other of the great railway corporations, and the only reason for granting which is to give contractors and promoters a puli enabling them to make money. That is the result of nine-tenths of the bonuses given to local railways in Canada, and I think a good purpose will be served by the reading of the circular, *which has been quoted by the hon. member for South Lanark (Mr. Haggart), if it will bring the attention of the government of the Dominion and of the various provinces to the absolute waste of money that is being carried on through the bonusing of railways.

were issued in New York or any financial centre, and were not immediately repudiated if the' statements they contained were not true, the men whose names were attached would at once lose credit and would never again attain to any respectable position. I repeat that the only inference that can be drawn from such a circular as that is that there was a solid foundation for it, and it is quite clear that the president and the directors were led to believe that there was a solid foundation for the ' statements made as to the contract with the various governments. That was believed in New York to such an extent that the stock of that company, the securities of which consist solely and entirely of the contracts which are stated to have been received from the provincial and the Dominion governments ; the stock of that company was quoted some weeks ago at 110 or 120 when I last saw it. It may be down to nothing to-day or it may be 200 for all I know, but the last quotation I saw was 110 or 120. The inference to be drawn from that was that they had substantial grounds for believing that they had, or were going to obtain such contracts. I say that it is a slur upon the legislatures of the various provinces and of this parliament, that men of financial standing in New York or elsewhere could believe that they could make such a bargain with the various governments in the Dominion of Canada.

Now, Sir, if we are to have a reliable statement as to profit or loss in the working of railways, we must have a certain and distinct system of keeping the accounts. The hon. minister seems to think that there is some distinction between a railway owned by shareholders who may be looking for dividends and a railway owned by the government of Canada. I think the people of Canada take a sufficient interest in this question to desire that accounts shall be properly kept so that we shall know, positively whether the returns made by the minister are correct or not. I want ""to do again what I did last year-state in as few words as possible what is the well recognized rule as to charges to capital account and charges to maintainence account on railways. The a b c in this matter-and there is no exception in this respect in any railway company between this and Mexico- is that when capital has once provided a 1 Mr. OSLER.
property, whether it be a rail or a locomotive or a coach, the going concern shall maintain that at the expense of its revenue. That is the first principle, and that nobody disputes. If capital has provided, say a 50 pound rail, when that rail comes out, either in a week or a month, if broken, or after 20 years service, the revenue of the concern must replace it. If a company has 200 locomotives, it must maintain those locomotives at the expense of revenue. If locomotives are smashed up or worn out, revenue must replace them. When it has done so, when it has kept every locomotive of the 200 up to a state of efficiency, and the company buys 50 more, it may charge those 50 to capital, but it cannot charge one locomotive to capital so long as the old list is incomplete, and so as to coaches and cars, and indeed everything provided by capital. That is the rule, a throroughly recognized rule, which there is no question about any where, except, apparently, in the mind of the Minister of Railways. I wish to apply that rule to the hon. gentleman's charges on capital account; and having done so, I shall take the liberty of showing what the hon. gentleman's deficit would have been if he had thus applied the ordinary rules of railway companies.
Before doing that I wish to say a few words on the little controversy that arose a few minutes ago between the hon. member for South Lanark (Mr. Haggart) and the Minister of Railways as to the system adopted by the ex-minister of railways and the present minister. I have gone back only as far as the year 1895-6. In that year the hon. Mr. Haggart laid 45 miles of rails of a heavier description than had been on the track before. Every pound of those rails was charged to revenue. In 1896-7, the present Minister of Railways was in office. That hon. gentleman, in his first report, said :	' I have continued the system of
renewing the track with heavier rails ': and the hon. gentleman himself charged the whole to revenue. In the year 1897-8 the hon. minister laid 19J miles of heavier rails, every pound of which was charged to revenue ; he was following the example of the hon. Mr. Haggart, and very properly so. I will admit presently that perhaps he was not obliged to charge every pound of the heavier rails to revenue, but certainly he was right so far as he charged to the extent of the weight of the old rails. Now, we come to the year 1898-9, and the minister will recollect that that was the time he was preparing for his first surplus, the surplus just anterior to the general election. The hon. gentleman does not report that he laid one rail in that year. If he had done so. his little surplus would have gone to Halifax. In the next year, 1899-1900, the hon. gentleman set off on his new career. In that year he asked parliament to give him $420,000 for heavier rails, to be charged wholly to capital. By some means the hon. gentleman man-

aged to get that through ; there does not seem to have been any discussion about it; and for the first time the replacing of rails, which ought to have been charged almost entirely to revenue, was charged entirely to capital. In the last year, the accounts of which are before us this session, the hon. gentleman spent $402,000 upon rails, and charged every dollar of that to capital. I will show in a moment or two Just how much of that ought to have gone to revenue. I have calculated it here, and 1 rather think the hon. gentleman knows it ; at all events, I will give him the figures. Before giving these figures, I may say that the hon. gentleman is asking in his estimates $000,000 for rails and fastenings for the coming year; and in the current year he is expending even a larger sum for the like purpose ; the whole to be charged to capital, and added to the public debt of this Dominion. So something like $2,000,000 for rails will have been charged to capital when nearly two-thirds of that amount ought to have gone to revenue account. I asked Mr. Pottinger what he thought of charging to capital all the cost of replacing rails. The hon. gentleman will recollect Mr. Pottinger's answer : 1 Why should I object so long as parliament votes' the money ? ' The general manager knew peVfectly well what the proper system was, but it was a little too much to expect him to want to charge to revenue what parliament was so willing to give on capital account.
At page W-41 of the Auditor General's report, we find the details of the hon. gentleman's capital expenditure for rails. He began with 82 miles laid upon the Cape Breton division. These were old 50 pound rails which were admitted by Mr. Pottinger to be worn out. They had served their day, and the time had come to replace them in the ordinary course. If those 56 pound rails had been replaced by rails of similar weight, nobody for a moment would have supposed they would have been charged otherwise than to revenue, along with the fastenings, and the expense of laying the new rails ; and the hon. gentleman would have credited the revenue with the value of the old scrap rails taken up. That is the ordinary system. Bue he laid 80 pound rails, and charged the whole cost to capital. All he was entitled to charge to capital was the extra 24 pounds of rail laid. If he charges the 80 pounds to capital, he has a great deal more in his capital account than is represented by the weight of rails on the road ; that is, he has the original 50 lbs. and the new 80 lbs., in all, 130 lbs. He charges $350,491 for these rails. It was his duty to charge 5G

80ths of that amount to revenue. That would be $245,33G.	He was entitled to
credit to his revenue the old rails taken up, which would have given $108,240, leaving a net charge to revenue of $137,096. In the same way. the fastenings would have cost revenue $17,197 and the stores $7,000. Then
the hon. gentleman decided to charge the expense, i.e., the labour of relaying the track to capital. Why, these rails were there some 20 years. We had to replace them by new rails. The expenditure was an ordinary working expense, and yet he charges $200 per mile to capital account, thus adding to the debt of the country and relieving this deficit. That amount alone is $16,400. Adding all these together, we find that on that Cape Breton division he charges $177,692 to capital which should have been charged to working expenses. In other words he improves the appearance of his deficit by that amount.
Take the Moncton and Truro division, where we may make the same calculation, except that he took up 67 pound rails and replaced them by 80-pound rails. His charge against revenue should have been. $47,240. On the Campbellton division in the same way he should have charged $33,133 against revenue. And totalling up these three divisions, he should have charged against revenue $258,548, and his charge against capital should have been only $144,000. But he charged $402,000 to capital. If he had added that $258,548 which he should have charged against revenue, to his $488,000 ue-ficit, he would have come so much nearer the mark.
Now take his rolling stock. He reports that lie has 228 old locomotives and has added during the year 20, making 248. If the hon. gentleman had kept up his 228 locomotives in a thorough state of efficiency, he would have been entitled to charge the extra twenty to capital, but, let us see exactly how lie kept them up. The committee called as a witness the present mechanical superintendent, Mr. Muhlfeld. The report of the hon. gentleman, giving the 248 locomotives. is brought to the first of July last year, and Mr. Muhlfeld entered on his duties the 1st September, just two months later. Here is how this gentleman found these 248 locomotives. He was asked :
Q. What about the locomotives ? I suppose they were in good condition ?-A. Some were cud some were not. Some were pretty old.
Q. Some were pretty old.-A. Yes, it is not a matter of age, it is a matter of the time of service they have been in. There are some of the age that they are being condemned.
These are the locomotives which the hon. minister affects to think are in an efficient condition.
Q. How many of them ?-A. I cannot say exactly, I presume 25 or 30 that I know of.
That is the evidence of the mechanical superintendent. He says that 25 or 30 of the locomotives are in a position to be condemned, and yet the minister adds the 20 new ones to capital account, instead of charging them against revenue account as replacing so many of the 25 or 30. Further on this gentleman says something more on that subject:

Q. Would you hang on to a number of old locomotives, you could not work economically, wlren you could get some revenue out of them, and charge up to capital account those you replaced them by ?-A. No, sir, X would charge them up to revenue.
That is the statement of the hon. gentleman's own officer. It shows that the lion. Minister should have taken those new locomotives to replace condemned ones, which are either old scrap or should be sold to some people who are constructing new railways and would give $1,000 or $2,000 a piece for them. But the 20 new locomotives he has charged to capital account, and I repeat he had no right to so charge them until he had replaced the 25 or 30 condemned ones by 25 or 30 new ones. What is the result of that ? The 'hon. gentleman paid for his locomotives, which he bought this year, $346,000.- Assuming that he could have sold the condemned ones' for $46,000, that left a clean $300,000 that he had to charge against his revenue account. Take his admitted deficit of $488,000 and add the $258,000, that he ought to have charged for steel rails and these $300,000 for locomotives, and his deficit would be $1,046,000, and that is what any railway company would have made it.
The hon. gentleman took a lot of pains to show that if he had not spent so much his deficit would have been less. That is hardly controvertible, but I point out that if he charged to revenue what he did spend on revenue account, the deficit would be a great deal more.
Before I leave this question of locomotives I want to point out something else. The hon. gentleman got in all in the year 28 locomotives. He says that 20 were added to his stock. He really added 22, so I suppose there is some clerical error. But he charges 6 to revenue. He went that far but did not go far enough. He should have charged not only the 6 but the other 22 as well. The 6 are numbered small numbers, showing clearly that they replaced old locomotives, thus recognized the principle I am contending for, but he would not go far enough lest it should make his deficit worse.
He knows that he is bound to buy locomotives to replace the old ones that are condemned, or should be condemned, but it is too much for him to charge the whole to revenue, so he quietly charges 20 to capital.
Mr. Mulilfeld was examined about some locomotives leased by the Canadian Pacific Railway. He said that they were very old ones, which could not be used economically, and so they leased them to the Canadian Pacific Railway which could afford to use them. The very .fact that the hon. gentleman had, in addition to the 25, 10 or 11 that were so old that he could not use them economically, shows that even the 25 or 30. which Mr. Mulilfeld speaks, of, are not all he should have thrust aside and replaced out of revenue account.
The same with his ears. The hon. gentleman saves his expenses on car account as Mr. BARKER.
he does on locomotive account at every poiut. Mr. Muhlfeld is asked about the condition of the rolling stock, and he said it was in a very fair average condition. Well, considering that in the past three years the minister has added 1,861 new cars to his stock, or 27 per cent of the whole, at the expense of capital, I do not suppose that we need be surprised that a new man would think that the rolling stock was in pretty fair average condition. It must have been in a terrible state, if the 27 per cent addition did not bring it up to a pretty fair average. '
Let us see what he did to maintain his old stock. At the beginning of the year there were condemned cars, 442 of all kinds. During the year he condemned 145 more, making a total of 587 that were unfit for business. These were not cars which were laid aside for repairs, but condemned absolutely. He says in his report that he rebuilt 223. But still he leaves 364 unfit for service-condemned cars. I do not know that anybody would object very much to the hon. gentleman leaving these 364 cars to be re-built on a future occasion, provided he did not want the cars. But in the year we are dealing with, he buys 1,119 cars, and charges every, one of these to capital. His duty, clearly, was to charge 364 of them to revenue account, and then the remainder he could charge to capital. The 346 cars cost him a little over $250,000. That was a charge he made to capital account every dollar of which should have gone to revenue account. If we add this to the other items, we find that the hon. gentleman's real deficit, carrying every charge to revenue that any other railway company would, is $1,296,000. But by his system of accounts he comes out with an apparent deficit of $a8S,-000. No wonder the hon. gentleman wants to draw a distinction between what ordinary shareholders would expect and what the government expects in the administration of a railway. The hon. gentleman may say that this is mere book-keeping. The hon. Minister of Finance last year asked us what it mattered-that. If you had a deficit of $1,000,000, it is added to the debt of the country, and if you have a charge of $1,000,000 to capital it is added to the debt of the country. But there is more than that in it. What can be expected of the staff at Moncton if they are told in effect that it matters not how wasteful they are or how little attention they pay to the economical maintenance of the property. The effect of the hon. gentleman's method is to encourage waste and destruction. A mechanical superintendent finds that he has four or five hundred cars which will cost him a good deal to repair and maintain. What does a long-headed mechanical superintendent do when he is operating under methods such as we find here ? He says : Let the cars run for a year or two and the minister will get us others out of capital account, and so we will not have to repair them at all. And the same is

true of locomotives. I do not care liow honest a man may be, the temptation you put in his way by this method is too strong. He is not going to run up his maintenance account, upon which his very reputation depends, when he has an opportunity to keep that account down by having items charged to capital. With such opportunities offered him, an official will not repair anything if he can avoid it. Laxity and indifference are induced. That is the policy the hon. minister deliberately encourages. The result is shown in the enormous proportion of actual working expenses on this road, as admitted by the hon. minister himself.
The hon. minister spent about three-quarters of an hour before six o'clock re-feri'ing to various items of expenditure in the old accounts of the ex-Minister of Railways (Hon. Mr. Haggart). He spoke of new bridges constructed, of extending sidings, and enlarging accommodation at stations. Nobody has ever disputed that all these items might be charged to capital. What we question is the hon. gentleman's charging other items to capital. We question also the hon. minister's methods in dealing with charges properly against capital. I call attention to it because I think it is high time that the estimates of the Minister of Railways were more carefully considered. In 1900 the hon. gentleman took a vote for improvements and increased accommodation at Sydney, $39,000. Did the hon. gentleman limit his expenditure to that r No; he spent $137,324 on that work-$58,000 being for land alone. I am speaking now of real capital expenditure, but I want to show how the hon. minister deals with these things. Having spent $137,324 he transferred $41,324 of that to an entirely different item, a blanket item to which he had no right to charge one cent of this expenditure. He came down the following year and asked for a vote of $57,000 to make up the balance. Now, it would be far better and more business-like if we had given the hon. gentleman power to spend what he pleased, and held him responsible. He gets these estimates, but does not hold himself bound to them-spends what he pleases. The Minister of Finance has taunted us with taking two days for the examination of the Auditor General, and thought it was ridiculous, because the Auditor General knew nothing about the matters we asked about. It is true that we spent an hour and a half on each of two days in an earnest effort to show that the Auditor General did not know anything about these matters. The Minister of Finance seems peculiarly happy over the fact that the Auditor General could not tell us anything. But that was the very thing we were trying to demonstrate. People think when they see the Auditor General's great Blue-book, with the Auditor General's certificate to the accounts, these things must be 110
all right. But the Auditor General freely admitted that he knew nothing about many of these matters, and the hon. Minister of Finance was

The minister obtained authority to expend $8,000 to increase the station accommodation at that place. The minister advertised for tenders for that $8,000 work, and it was pointed out in the committee and proved that he paid $649.99 in advertising. He would not go the $650, but he got within one cent of it.

The minister knew he had authority to spend only $8,000 at that station, but what did he spend ? He spent in the year $15,719.53, and there is $1,575.26 yet to pay, making a total expenditure of $17,249.79, upon the authority of this House to spend $8,000. That is the objection we are making. The Auditor General said such expenditure was all wrong, and he would write that that sort of thing must not occur again.
Then I will take another item. The Minister of Railways and Canals got the authority of this House to build three engine houses. He advertised for tenders, and what do you suppose the hon. gentleman spent in advertising for that work ? One thousand three hundred and sixty-four dollars and ninety-eight cents. The hon. gentleman wonders that we criticise his accounts ; he says we are objecting to them



as capital expenditure. We are not objecting to them as capital expenditure, but we object to the methods of the hon. gentleman.
Take another station in which tne hon. gentleman has great interest. He happens to represent the city of St. .John. The expenditure there was $219,752 in this one year. That is a very small item compared to the expenditures there since the hon. gentleman has become Minister of Railways and Canals. I think in that city something over $1,000,000 has been spent. Now he wants to make a fine station yard at the outskirts of the town. He got 36 acres of marsh land and paid $475 an acre for. it, or $17,138 for marsh land upon which to lay sidings. Well, he did more. He charged for the materials for those sidings. He is going to lay 12 miles, and he charged for the rails and other materials for these sidings, $46,620.77. That was in 1900, and to this hour not more than one mile has been laid. That is another thing that we object to. The hon. gentleman says: You are objecting to capital expenditure, you are objecting to the sidings at stations. It is convenient for him to put it that way. I repeat again, it is the method of the hon. gentleman we are objecting to. If he had spent that money properly for needed sidings, nobody would raise any objection. But he charges capital with material which, it is admitted by Mr. Pottinger, is lying along the track at this hour. It is not at St. John at all. He has charged for ties 30 cents apiece that are lying in heaps 100 miles away, he has charged for spikes, and bolts and rails that are not delivered there at all. Yes, he charged in 1900 to capital $46,020.77 . on that account.
There is another thing I may as well comment upon, showing the methods of the hon. gentleman. He charges capital account $20 per ton for these rails that have just been taken out of the main line, and into store at only $15. So he makes for his store account 33 per cent profit in that transaction. That is a pretty fair profit, even if you are selling to a stranger. But what is the result of it ? He has a store account of three or four million dollars in the course of a year, nearly every item of which is charged out at some profit; thus every year or two there must be a considerable accumulation of profits in that store account and nobody hears what becomes of it. I do not charge the hon. gentleman with pocketing it, but I have no doubt whatever that it goes to the benefit of his working expenses, and that the deficit would otherwise be so much the worse.

There were the Copper Crown works at Pictou. Those are smelting works started at Pictou that nobody ever expected would amount to anything, they have become a bankrupt concern as I am told. The hon. gentleman has spent $20,000 for sidings at those works at the expense of this country. The ordinary course of a manufacturing concern dealing with a railway company is, when they think the wrorks will pay, to put in the sidings and if they have got traffic they get rebates until the amount is wiped out. But the hon. gentleman was more generous than that. He led them to expect that if they would put in the siding he would pay for it in due time, just as soon as he could get the order of this House. Let us see how this was done.	One peculiarity about
this business is that there was a Mr. E. N. Macdonald, who was a candidate at the general elections on the ministerial side, was the solicitor for this Copper Crown Works Company.

He claimed a profit of $60,000 last year and of $120,000 the year before. According to my contention he was behind fully half a million dollars on each occasion. I am going to show that under the methods of hon. gentleman it is a wonder he did not have working expenses of 150 per cent instead of 110 per cent. There is no excuse at all for the hon. gentleman. He is getting a very good traffic upon the Intercolonial Railway. It is not at all, as the hon. gentleman perhaps thinks, that this large traffic is due to himself.

The hon. gentleman gets $3,820 per mile. This is the revenue for a road 1,302 miles in length. Let us compare that with some other roads that are not in anything like so good a condition. There is, for instance, the1 Canada Eastern Railway in the hon. gentleman's own district having a mileage of 136 miles. The gross earnings per mile are $981. It is much more difficult to work a short road of that kind having a small traffic at anything like a low rate.

That company works the road at 91 per cent. It is a high rate. But, if the rate at which the company works that road be applied to the Intercolonial Railway the latter would have given a profit of $447,500 instead of a loss of $488,000. We will take a still smaller road, the Massawippi Valley Railway in the province of Quebec, a very small line. Its earnings per mile are almost up to those of the Intercolonial. That company works its railway at 85 per cent. It is a high rate, but if that ratio of expenses were applied to the Intercolonial Railway it would give a profit of $745,000, instead' of a loss of $488,000. I would like to point out some lines which are a little greater in length. There is the Canada Atlantic with a mileage of 458 miles which is worked at 79 per cent, the Lake Erie and Detroit River Railway with a mileage of 180 miles which is worked at 60 per cent and the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway which is worked at 76 per cent. All these roads are worked at a disadvantage as compared with the Intercolonial Railway.

They earn more per train mile. That is the only difference. But, take the Canadian Pacific Railway for example; that company only earns $4,170 per mile as against $3,820 per mile of earnings on the Intercolonial Railway, and it works the road at 60J per cent. I have taken one hundred railways in the United States, roads of all classes, long and short, roads that run at high rates and roads that run at low rates, having all classes of traffic, and I find that the highest working expenses of any road amongst the whole one hundred were 78-5 per cent, while the average of the one hundred roads was 65-57 per cent. The Canadian Pacific Railway's working expenses are 60J per cent, the Grand Trunk Railway's working expenses are 67 per cent and the government's 110 per cent. But if we cannot have the profits in money, let us see if we cannot have the figures. If the Intercolonial Railway were worked even at the highest ratio of expense, amongst those one hundred railways of the United States it would have shown a profit of $1,029,000. As the hon. minister is working at a loss of $488,000, that makes a difference of $1,517,000 in the comparison of their work. If they worked at the average rate of 65-57, the profit would be $1,690,000. which considering the loss of $488,000. makes a difference of $2,178,000, against the hon. gentleman. And I desire to add that, as I have already Mr. BARKER.
shown, $488,000 is by no means the full deficit.

Now, * station expenses ' is a thing that does not vary much from year to year, but the salaries of station masters, agents, clerks, telegraph operators and so on, have been increased by $74,000 over the previous year. The salaries of the general manager, traffic manager, and so on, have increased by $29,000 over the previous year, and in the chief accountant's office there was an increase of $6,500. But there is another account here, the general stores account, which deserves some comment. The minister purchased in the year on this account $3,433,823 as against $1,752,911 in the preceding year. That is a very important difference. He purchased just about double in the year of the general election what he did in the preceeding year. The minister issued stores during the year to the extent of $1,665,000, so he purchased twice as much as he issued, and he carries over in stock at the end of the year, beyond what he used, to the extent of $1,824,977 or nearly $900,000 more than he did the preceding year. I just mention these items to give a general idea of the extravagance of the minister in this year and as tending to show why he lost $488,000 in working in 1900 when he claimed a profit of $120,000 in the preceding year.
We have heard a great deal about the purchase of ties. That is a public scandal in the province of New Brunswick. I have given a good deal of attention to it and I intend to deal with it to-night, because I believe it requires the utmost attention of every hon. gentleman in the House. It is one of the most extraordinary stories that lias ever been narrated as regards any administration whether by a government or by a private railway company. In 1900 the number of ties actually used was 495,000. Mr. Pottinger told us that the largest number ever used in any year in the history of the road was 650,000. The minister began the year with 127,000 in stock so that if he bought half a million he would have been still on the right side and would have at least 120,000 surplus at the end of the year, after using the 495,000. But I must repeat again, and it cannot be repeated too often, that this was election year. Mr. Pottinger tells ns that about September he had a conference with the minister, and decided to ask tenders for 800,000 ties, but he got only about 335,000 under the tenders.

Mr. Pottinger in his evidence refers to the different qualities of ties. He said the life of a white spruce tie was about four years, the life of a black spruce tie six years, and the life of a cedar tie from six to ten years. But what 1 wish to call the attention of the committee particularly to, is the difference between white spruce and black spruce. The white spruce tie is practically worthless. As it only lasts four years, it is hardly worth the expense of putting it into the track and taking it out again. When you add the price to the cost of putting the tie in and taking it out again, the road was better without it. I wish to call attention to that, because there were enormous quantities of spruce ties ordered without specifying whether they were to be black or white spruce, and of course the contractors delivered the white spruce. And I may also say that owing to these enormous orders in that year, the result happened which might have been expected. Up went the prices from 25 per cent to 30 per cent, owing to the enormous demands made by the department when they did not need anything iike the quantity they ordered. They have now on hand a supply for two or three years ahead, and are only ordering in consequence a very small quantity, and the prices this year have gone down to the normal figures from 17 cents to 20 cents so far as any purchases have been made.

He had a contract for 105,070 Princess pine at 29 and 30 cents ; 84,224 cedar at 2S cents ; and 1S5,819 spruce at 25 9-10 cents. Then he had 25.S93 hemlock, 3,380 tamarac, and 33S juniper. altogether his contract was for 408,724 ties, or nearly one-third of the whole quantity purchased that year, and he was paid $177,248. Thus Mr. M. Curran got in the election year $25,000 more than the total sum paid for ties on the Intercolonial Railway in the previous year. They did not require one of those spruce ties. They had more ties than they needed of a good class, yet they were so anxious that this Mr. Curran and a few others should get contracts that they purchased an enormous quantity which they did not want and got ties the road would have been better without. One hon. gentleman on the committee suggested to us that the real owner of these Curran ties was a Conservative. He seemed to think that that was an answer to the whole thing, that it was all right because a Conservative owned the ties. It struck me that it was the old question of the intermediary. The contract was given where it would do most good, and Mr. Curran, a friend of the government, got it. A Conservative probably could not have got it in any other way. It went where it would do most good, and among gentlemen no doubt who understood. as another minister has told us on one occasion, that ' business is business.' There is another extraordinary feature about this. In May of last year a complaint was made to the engineer of construction that a great many bad ties had been received. Mr. Pottinger was asked at the Public Accounts Committee about these bad ties, and he knew absolutely nothing about them in April of the following year. He had heard that complaints had been made and that there had been an investigation. but he did not know whether any report had been made. Several meetings later he heard that a report had been made in November last, and that nothing had been done since. That is all Mr. Pottinger could tell us. Well, Mr. McManus was called, but before I refer to his testimony I would like to read the result of the investigation or reinspection of these ties so far as it has gone. A Mr. Williams was detailed by the
engineer of construction to inspect these ties which Mr. McManus had passed. On the 4th November, Mr. Williams made a report. I have gone carefully through it, and I find that he inspected 300,000 ties, over about seventy or eighty miles of road, that is, up to November, 1901, he had inspected less than one-quarter of all the ties purchased in 1900-1.

The following summer an investigation was ordered, and Mr. Williams was sent to inspect the work of Mr. McManus, and as so far has reported on 300,000 of the ties with these results :
The ties are of two classes-a tie eight or nine feet long, six inches thick, and seven inches face. Another class, six inches thick and six Inches face. Those would he classed as passable ties under the contract. Of the 6x7 there were 55,113 good ties. Of the 6x6 there were 54,941 good ties. That made 119,054 out of 306,000.

Except in cedar, rotten hearted or hollow headed ties mean bad ties. In cedar only ties with a very bad heart or hollow hearts are shown.
He passed to ones that were not very bad in cedar. Then were fir ties, which everybody agrees should not have been used as ties at all, 21,172 and poplar, 57. Or a total of 195,509 bad ties out of 306.000, and less than one-quarter of the whole inspected.

Well, he read letter after letter until he came to one from the manager of a coal mine down there who conveyed the information to him, and as he went on reading it turned out that the manager of that mine was telling Mr. Pottinger that they expected some trouble with their men, and there might be an interruption in the delivery of coal for a day or two. Mr. Pottinger having read that far read no further. I think that is about the extent of the threatened strike. But after all, what possible excuse was there for buying this 128,935 tons more than the manager wanted ? Was it because it was convenient to rush off to St. John and give a contract of $46,000 to Thompson & Co. for freight of coal from the United States ? That was a nice little contract by itself. They bought 60.000 tons from the States at high prices. It seems that in the excitement of buying the hon. gentleman in that year wanted to purchase everything that he could lay his hands on, cars, locomotives, an enormous quantity of supplies, enormous quantities of bolsters from Chicago, $67,000 worth, bolsters from Moncton, or neighbourhood-everything on a most gigantic scale, until he ran his purchases up to $3,000,000 odd in that year, double what lie had ever purchased before. Yet the hon. gentleman comes here to-night and speaks as if the fact that he bought so much and paid so much for the materials was an excuse for his high expenses. No doubt it had a great deal to do with it, but I do not think it is much of an excuse for the hon. gentleman. An ordinary business man, when he found prices for ties were high, would have curtailed the quantity in every possible way. When he found the price of coal was high he would have done the same

thing. But the hon. gentleman does the opposite, he seems to think the way to bring the price of ties and coal down is to order all you can. I do not know whether there is any other explanation of it. But I would like to show how the hon. minister is getting on, as he grows older as Railway Minister. His stocks carried in 'store at the end of the year 1897-98 were $108,402. That is a pretty good quantity. The next year, 189890. the .stocks remaining in store amounted to 553.177 : in 1900 the stocks) carried were $971,054, that is the surplus at the end of the year. This last year, this wonderful purchasing year, the stocks carried were $1,824,977, four times what they were in 1898. That is good administration, that is successful administration. It is very successful for the dealer, the people who want to sell ties and all that sort of thing, and probably for the coal dealers and other merchants down there. But I think that even the people of New Brunswick, notwithstanding the enormous purchases that are made along the line, would prefer to see this railway economically managed and to see its business done in a proper manner. The people down east have just as much interest in the economical management of the road as we, in this part of the country, who have to share in paying the cost. I do not think that there is one man in New Brunswick but would stamp out this thing to-day if he could, and the sooner they stamp out these things, such as the letter to McManus, and these extravagant purchases the better it will be for New Brunswick and this Dominion.
Now, I have only a very few words more. I have a little regard for hon. gentlemen opposite and I am sorry that I have taken so much time. If any hon. gentleman wants to understand and appreciate the extent of purchases let him take the Auditor General's report and give half an hour to wading through that and he will see the most marvellous state of things that has ever existed upon any railway. Just one word as to what lias led to this. The hon. Minister of Railways and Canals a few years ago made up his mind that he would enter into competition and have a fight with the Canadian Pacific Railway. He was determined to be the railway king. He was going to show all these railway magnates at Montreal a thing or two about the working of railways. He was determined to centre business in St. John. He built an elevator there, enormous expenditures were made for heavy rails, heavy locomotives and a large quantity of cars. Millions upon millions have been spent upon that project and the hon. gentleman was going to fight the Canadian Pacific Railway. Well, Sir, he has practically abandoned the fight. It is very like the King of France who, with 30,000 men, marched up the hill and then marched down again. The hon. gentleman has spent his Mr. BARKER.
millions and we are no farther advanced from a railway point of view than we were before. In fact, we are worse off. There is an enormous expenditure of capital which we cannot get back and the expenditure of that money might as well have been distributed over five or ten years instead of taking place in one or two years. What was the hon. gentleman intending to do ? He was proposing, while working the Intercolonial Railway at 110 per cent, to enter into a fight with a company that work at 60J per'cent. He attempted to compete with a company whose line to St. Jo fin was 481 miles while his line was 50 per cent longer, or 740 miles, so that the hon. gentleman was going to carry the traffic 259 miles for nothing and fight the Canadian Pacific Railway. That was the contest he entered into. I think it is very fortunate that It is nearly stopped. It is a good thing for the country. I ask again was there anything in all this to justify the congratulations of the hon. Minister of Finance. That hon. gentleman must have known all this. He must have been familiar with all this expenditure every ten days throughout the year, because he gets the returns of the Railway Department and publishes them in his ten day statement; yet, In the face of the knowledge of these enormous expenditures, the hon. gentleman congratulates the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals on what he termed the success of the Intercolonial Railway. I do not know whether it is necessary to say anything more upon that. What can the hon. Minister of Finance possibly condemn if he congratulates anyone upon results of this kind ? I am sorry that I have had to occupy so much time. There is a great deal more which I could have said but I have taken so much time to-night that I will not further presume upon the indulgence of the committee. I can only say that I have been very careful in extracting these figures from the various documents and I doubt whether the lion. Minister of Railways and Canals can find one error in them. If there is an error it is a very small one and I shall be the first to acknowledge it if he points it out.
