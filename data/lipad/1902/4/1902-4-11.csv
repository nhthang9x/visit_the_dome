Amongst other things it provides that rules of court be made by judges to regulate procedure, but it says nothing as to what is to be done in the event of there being no rules of court, which has occurred in our province, and may occur in other provinces.

Tbe Item as you will see is considerably increased over the corresponding item last year, which was $188,600. I may say* that while there is some increase in a number of the branches of this department, the chief increase here is due to an undertaking which we have decided upon on behalf of the cheese industry in Canada. Last season's cheese trade was not quite so satisfactory as the cheese trade of Canada has been for many years past and the causes of this have become quite apparent not only to the Department of Agriculture but to those who are engaged in the trade. It appears evident that the demand in England has been for a slightly different character of cheese from that which Canada has been supplying in the past and that to meet that demand our people have been endeavouring to make a softer and moister cheese, sending it forward under the old conditions. These old conditions were quite satisfactory for the harder and dryer cheese which Canada has been supplying in such large quantities for many years, but are not suitable for the character of tbe cheese now demanded by the English market and which our people have been trying to send forward. That quality of cheese requires that it should be cured and handled in a cooler temperature. A great deal of tbe injury that has been done during tbe last season or two has been done in the curing rooms of the factories. It is well known that these curing rooms are not very thoroughly constructed as a general rule and that tbe heat is not under control, especially in the hot weather of summer. A series of experiments has been carried on for some years back by my department. Another series has been carried on by tbe Guelph Agricultural College and still another series with most important results in the state of New York. The results of these experi-

ments have all tended in one direction, [DOT]wonderfully coinciding one with the other, and proving conclusively that this moister and softer cheese which is to-day in demand in the English market must be kept at a temperature below 65 degrees if it is to be successfully made and handled. The question came up : How will you bring about a change of methods to accomplish this object ? My department has been for two years inculcating the necessity for this change, pointing out the results of the experiments that have been made and urging people in every way possible, by addresses at public meetings and by bulletins and reports, to improve their curing rooms so that they might be able to cure their cheese under the new conditions properly. I think, largely due to the fact that the year before last the general price of the article was pretty good notwithstanding the difficulties. the people have disregarded these warnings. During the last season, however. they got a rather severe castigation, if X may call it that, in the English market. We had report after report showing that Canadian cheese was not doing as well as it had been doing in the past, that it was arriving very deficient in the proper quality and that the price of our cheese was not as good in proportion to the price of other cheese in the English market as it had been in the past. The result was the farmers and cheese makers of Canada lost in the last season somewhere about $2,000,000 on the quality of their cheese alone. I venture to think that if the advice of the Department of Agriculture, which was given to them two years ago, had been followed that money would have been saved. No doubt a portion of it would have had to have been spent in the improvements which were required, but still, a very large amount would have been left in the pockets of the people more than they received. In investigating this question the proposition has been made that as it was pretty difficult for the people to improve their curing rooms all over the country in every individual factory, central curing rooms should be established to which the cheese of a group of factories would be brought, thus carrying out the principle of co-operative dairying a little step farther than it has been carried in the past. Just as in days gone by the milk which used to be made into cheese in the home dairy has been carried to the central factory for the purpose of making it into cheese, so, the cheese, after being made, will be carried to a centra] curing room to be cured. It is felt that some other improvements in connection with the business might be also tried and shown and that the result would be, not only on the point I have just elaborated, beneficial, but on several other points, also, improvements in the trade would be brought about. These propositions were laid before the great dairy conventions of the country during last fall and winter and
were approved by these dairy conventions. The question was : How could this change be brought about ? It means generally through the country a very considerable investment in what up to the present time is an experiment-an experiment which has borne the test of careful Analysis and investigation on the part of experts, and having been laid before those engaged in the business, has met with their approval, but still, is a thing which has never been tried anywhere else or in Canada either. We have been in the habit, in my department, of doing work of an experimental character for the benefit of the people concerned, but which no individual would be willing to undertake, and which no individual, or group of individuals, could fairly be called upon to undertake. The risk, in other words, of the results of an experiment of this kind should be undertaken by the government and paid for out of public funds rather than by individuals. I, therefore, propose to establish four such curing rooms, one in the western part of Ontario, one in the eastern part of Ontario, one in the French-speaking part of the province of Quebec and one in the English-speaking part of the province of Quebec. Some exception has been taken to the fact that only four of these curing rooms are going to be carried on. Being of an experimental character I think it is desirable that enough should be done to show that if this experiment is successful it can be fairly held to be true under different conditions and under different circumstances, while at the same time, 1 think it is wise in an experiment of this kind not to build any more than is absolutely necessary to prove the results. The conditions in the particular localities that are indicated are sufficiently diverse to be fairly representative of the conditions in Canada, and the scale on which it is proposed to carry on these experiments will be sufficiently great, I think, that if	it is successful	in
these places it will be held to be successful almost anywhere in Canada. At the same time I feel that the investment of public money in this way is warranted by the magnitude of the interests involved. I need not dwell on the importance of our cheese industry. We know that in some years as much as $20,000,000 worth of cheese has been exported from Canada, and that has been of great value not only to the farmers but to the industrial development of the industries of Canada generally. It is the one industry in which Canada has maintained a pre-eminence, and anything that tends to make this industry a continued success is worthy of attention. In doing this work we will require a capital investment of about $8,000 or $10,000 for each of these curing rooms, and we will require money for maintenance during the current year, which for the four curing rooms will amount in all to $35,000 or $30,000. I trust that the maintenance will not

be a serious drain upon tlie department. Our experiments show that the cheese cured in the cool temperature which we propose to provide will not only be of better quality and consequently bring a higher price, but there will also be very materially less shrinkage in the curing process. While we have not absolutely decided upon all the details, our proposition is that the owners of the cheese will reap all the advantage of the increased price per pound, but that the gain made by the less shrinkage shall go to.the maintenance of the curing room. I think that will pay for all the expenses of the curing room in a commercial sense. But we expect to make some other experiments and to do some other work for the benefit of the cheese trade, and I do not think that the expense of this will lie covered by the sum I have mentioned. In this estimate we are providing for not only the capital expenditure in building the curing rooms, but also for a sum to help in the management of them for rne current year. This involves altogether nearly $40,000, or a very considerable amount more than the increase which is to be noticed in this item.
In other ways the expenditure will be largely on the same lines as in the past. There will be some increases and some slight decreases. The general lines of the work are briefly these. We have the headquarters staff and expenses at Ottawa; we have the extension of markets division ; the cold storage division ; the live , stock commissioners' division; the dairy division and the fruit division; all under the general direction of Professor Robertson, the commissioner of dairying and agriculture.

The MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, I wish first to give a general sketch of the work included under this vote, and then I will be pleased to answer any questions afterwards. As I have said, we have the extension of markets division, which covers generally the work for the improvement of our products and of the handling of our products between here and the foreign markets. It includes the watching of the loading and of the unloading of vessels on this side of the Atlantic, and on .arrival in the old country. It includes the work we have been doing to improve the poultry trade in Canada, and also our efforts to improve the quality of the grain and seed which is used by our farmers. In a general way, that is what is embraced in that particular division. We have for this purpose several men in Montreal watching the loading of ships with our Canadian products, and giving us information which we are constantly laying before the different transportation companies, urging upon them Hon. Mr. FISHER.
improvement in their methods. We have men also engaged in St. John and Halifax during the winter season. We have also men in the old country watching the landing of our products there, and when time permits, watching the markets and giving information as to the condition of our products when they arrive in these markets. The advice which is given by the handlers in Great Britain is of great importance in the improvement of the packing and management of our products, and it is reported by these gentlemen.
We have also been introducing iuto this country within the last few years, entirely new methods of dealing with poultry meat. Until comparatively recently in Canada, hardly any one thought of fattening the chickens which they sent to the market. The result was, that Canadian poultry while good in quality, was generally not up to the mark in condition when put on the home market, or the British market. Some years ago, Professor Robertson and myself when in Great Britain came in contact with what was being done there. We found that a most extensive business was being done in the fattening of poultry and we found that these fattened poultry brought a very much higher price than the ordinary birds. We knew that our Canadian poultry was being sent to England in the ordinary condition, and we did not see why the advantages of this improved fattening process should not be obtained for the Canadian 1 manufacturers. We set to work to experiment with regard to this system in Canada. We established some stations where birds were fattened and sent to England. The results were extremely satisfactory ; so satisfactory that we were able to induce people to go into the business. The progress has not been very rapid, but it has been very considerable. As will be seen by the trade returns, the poultry meat exported to Great Britain has increased from something under $20,000 four years ago, to something over $200,000 last' year. In addition to that increase in the trade, I may say that there has been an immense stimulus given to the feeding of poultry for the home market, and to-day the men who handle poultry in centres like Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa are prepared to take all the fattened poultry they can get at remunerative prices, and the only complaint they have made to us is that they cannot get enough to fill their orders. This stimulus has been given by the department during the last three or four years ; and while it was originally intended for the export trade which was rendered possible by the introduction of mechanical cold storage in the steamers crossing the Atlantic, it has extended to the home market in a way which we hardly anticipated when we began it. We have been trying experiments in this line, the details of which I have in my hand and could give. They have all been published in the evidence given before the

Committee, on Agriculture and in the annual report of my department.
The next branch is what I call the cold storage division, which now involves two distinct branches. When we first discussed cold storage in this country and introduced it in its improved form, of mechanical cold storage, we wanted to provide comparatively small cold chambers on the vessels for the purpose of carrying across the Atlantic . certain perishable products which otherwise could not be carried at all and be kept in proper condition. This was chiefly necessary for butter, which up to that time had never been landed in the British market in the condition in which it had left the creamery or the producer in Canada. For some time past, practically all the butter that has gone from Canada-and the export of butter has increased from about $1,000,000 in 1896 to $5,000,000 in 1901- has gone in these cold storage chambers in a frozen condition, and is laid down in the English market in practically the same condition that it leaves the creamery in Canada. That is possible by reason, first of all, of the introduction of cold storage refrigerators at the creameries, which we have stimulated by giving a bonus.

34750,ca.proc.d.1902-04-11.3.2.4,1902-04-11,intervention,,,,SUPPLY.,,,"No, it is only given to factories which make, butter in the summer. We have not given any bonus for cooling chambers in cheese factories. There are a large number of factories in Canada, which sometimes make butter in summer, as well as cheese, and if they do that we have allowed the bonus to them, the condition being that they must retain the refrigerator room at a certain temperature to become entitled to the bonus. At the present time I think over three-fourths of the factories in Canada fulfil these conditions. Then, cold storage is provided in iced refrigerator cars, numbers of which leave all parts of the country and converge at the ports. At the ports private enterprise hasi almost entirely fulfilled the necessity of providing cold storage accommodation, for the holding of those perishable products which the owners wish to be held. If they are to be transferred direct to the steamer from the cars, our officers watch that transference to see that no damage is done and that the goods are properly handled. If they are not properly handled, reports are immediately made, and complaints are sent to the transportation companies, and the owners are notified. On the steamers there has been for some years back full accommodation for all the product going forward which requires mechanical cold storage on the steamers. Occasionally instances may have arisen where a particular shipment was destined for some
port to which there was no regular line of steamers. I believe that in one or two instances a particular steamer at a particular time was full, and the goods had to wait for a few days or a week for another steamer; but in a general way in the last year or two there has been sufficient of this mechanical refrigeration on the vessels going from Canada to meet the demands of trade.
Now, I want to allude to another kind of what I may call cold storage, although it is different in its essence from this; that is, the principle of cooling the ordinary holds of vessels where certain goods are stored for transport. As a general rule during the shipping season of apples and the big shipping season of cheese, the owners and shippers do not care to pay the extra charges for the cold storage chambers proper, and moreover there are such large quantities of apples going forward for a few mouths in the fall of the year that it would be practically impossible for the steamers to provide mechanical cold storage for all that freight. Many of the shippers also believe-and I am not prepared to deny it-that it is not at all necessary for cheese or apples to be carried in these cold storage insulated chambers which are cooled by mechanical refrigeration. Under these'- circumstances they send their cheese and apples forward in the ordinary holds of the vessels; and when tne holds are battened down and shut up tight, without any complete system of ventilation, there is no doubt that there has been serious injury to our apples and our cheese going forward in days gone by. We have urged the steamship companies to obviate that difficulty. We have represented to them that it 'was necessary to put in not'only the ordinary ventilating shafts, but fans, so that a mechanical generation of a current of air through the holds would be obtained; and furthermore we have in the last year believed and inculcated that for this purpose there ought to be a mechanical refrigerating plant on the vessels, with a chamber where the air couldi be artificially cooled down to a low temperature, and that air forced through the holds of the vessels where the cheese and apples are stored. The plan of putting in fans and simply ventilating with the air at the ordinary temperature has been pretty successfully initiated and carried out. The other plan of a refrigerating chamber where the air would be cooled to a very low temperature and forced through has only J*en begun in the past season. We were alilfe to induce companies to put four ships under that arrangement last season, and we have received the most convincing evidence from the shippers, the receivers in the old land and the owners of those ships, that, for the carriage of our cheese and apples, that system is most eminently satisfactory. I- may : say that, with the single exception of the

257t>
newly subsidized line from Bristol to the West Indies, the ships we have been dealing with are the only ones I know of in the world fitted up in that way. This system, I am glad to say, will be very largely extended this season now opening. We have been negotiating with other vessel owners, and I am in a position to state that this coming season there will ibe at least ten more vessels fitted up in this way for trading in the St. Lawrence.

From the experience we had last year, I am satisfied that this system will be the ultimate one adopted by all the ships coming to Canada which expect to carry large quantites of cheese or fruit. We havp had to do the same kind of thing that we did in the case of the original cold storage scheme, namely, bear a share of the cost-of fitting the vessels up, and make a similar contract. The experiment I am happy to say, has justified our expectations. By the contracts we then made with the shipowners to fit up their ships with this apparatus, we agreed to pay half the cost of fitting up, on the understanding that the cost should extend over, in the first case, three years, and in the second, two years ; and the results have justified our expectations that the ships would continue with that apparatus after the contract had expired. To-day a large number of the vessels now leaving Canadian ports and not subsidized at all by the government, are fitted up in that way, and when any new ship is being built for the St. Lawrence trade, it is well understood that it is necessary it should be fitted up with this cold storage system. Gratifying as has been the success of the work we have undertaken I am satisfied that when we have got the other system I have been describing, thoroughly into working order, similar results will follow, and that in the near future every steamer which expects to carry our apples and cheese across the Atlantic will be fitted up with this arrangement.
I shall not go into details just now on the particular expenditure in that line, although it is somewhat larger than last year. [DOT]
With regard to the railways, the system has been constantly extended. We have today a larger! number of lines fitted up with this system than we had any year before, and are occasionally receiving requests to have more put on, which we immediately act upon.
I hope this year to have an additional officer, whose duty it will be to watch more 1 closely the carriage by these railways of i our cold storage products. That work is c Hon. Mr. FISHER.

He there watches carefully the ' arrivals, makes note of the shipments re-' ceived, the condition in which they arrive, 5 and the temperature maintained. His obser-; nations show that the work, on the whole, 5 has been satisfactorily done, but we have 1 complaints occasionally, especially at points * where the cars stop on their way to Montreal, and where there are converging lines , coming together, and I think it would con' <Uice to greater efficiency and the removal , of any such complaints, if we had an inspector, whose business it would be to take special charge of this particular work. I hope to be able to provide for such an officer during the coming year.
I have a statement here with regard to the creameries. I find that there are, roughly speaking, in the neighbourhood of TOO creameries in Canada, and that up to the present about 500 have been fitted, leaving in the neighbourhood of 200 which have not yet complied with the conditions , and got the bonus.

Returns do not indicate the province or origin of the goods. But I may say, in general terms, that, of the butter exported from Montreal nearly all goes from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Last year there was a little of North-west and Manitoba butter exported from Montreal. For a year or two there was scarcely any export of this kind, the great bulk of the western butter going to British Columbia and the Yukon and some little to Japan. But, during the season just jjassed, the trade there did not absorb the whole of the territorial and Manitoba production, and some was sent to Montreal and exported to Great Britain. Of the maritime provinces butter and cheese a certain proportion sometimes comes to Montreal. That depends on so many things that it is difficult to exactly gauge it. The Montreal merchants engaged in this business handle the great bulk of this trade for the country, and they buy in the maritime provinces as well as in Quebec and Ontario. Sometimes they ship direct from Halifax and other ports, but sometimes they bring the butter and cheese to Montreal and keep them in cold storage until they are ready to ship.

Of course, we have in the department the details of every application that comes in, but I have not obtained the figures by provinces. I think there again the great bulk of the applications would come from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Speaking from memory and subject to correction which, perhaps Professor Robertson can give me, the greater number of applications lately have come from Quebec. There are more creameries in the province of Quebec, in proportion to the population, than in the province of Ontario. Ontario has taken a great lead in cheese production, but in butter production, I think Quebec has rather taken the lead, at least in the number of factories and the proportional amount of butter produced. I have just received a memorandum from Professor Robertson, saying that, so far as the exports are concerned, about three-quarters come from Quebec and about one-quarter comes from Ontario. And the bonuses to creameries are in about the same proportion.

These men would get bonuses on a number of creameries, yet every individual who asks for a bonus and complies with the conditions receives it; and it is as easy for the owner of one creamery to comply with the conditions for one building as for'the owner of ten to comply with the conditions for ten buildings.

The butter production for that fiscal year was smaller in consequence of the price of cheese. We have a certain amount of milk in Canada to be made up into butter or cheese. Some seasons a larger proportion is made into butter and some seasons a larger proportion is made into cheese. It happened that the season for the calendar year 1900 opened very well for cheese, and, during that calendar year there was a very much larger quantity of milk made into cheese than there was [DOT] made into butter. The year before, the butter export had been very large. The result was that, in the fiscal year commencing 1st July, 1900, and ending 30th June, 1901, there was less butter produced for export than there had been for the year before. The conditions, however, apparently, have changed a little, and last calendar year, the year just closed, we had a much larger export of butter. In this last calendar year-we sometimes reckon butter and cheese production and exports by the season, and then in the Trade and Navigation Returns they are entered by the fiscal year-in the season of 1901 again there was a much greater production of butter, as a matter of fact, about $5,000,000 worth in round figures, was exported. During the season of 1900 there was much less exported; during the season of 1899 there was about $5,000,000 worth of butter exported. I think the explanation is that the factorymen and the patrons thought that season that cheese was going to sell rather better than butter. As my hon. friend will notice, this last calendar year in which, as I have pointed out, there was a great increase in the butter exports, there was a very decided decrease of cheese exports.

I looked In my office, and my secretary has not been able to find the letters in regard to it. I think what I said was that I had consulted people engaged in the live stock business. If I said letters, I have not yet been able to lay my hands on any particular letters of that nature. But I have under my hand, and will read to the House, or give them to the hon. gentleman, letters in large- numbers endorsing the appointment. *1 did consult the live stock men, and I know of my own knowledge what Mr. Hodson had been doing before in Ontario, and I felt I was right in choosing him for that position. I think the event has justified the choice most amply, and I will read later on, if the hon. gentleman wishes it, some statements that have appeared over the signatures of leading live stock men, and I have resolutions of live stock associations endorsing the appointment of that gentleman, and pointing out how eminently qualified he is for that position. But aside from the appointment of a live stock commissioner, I have endeavoured to stimulate the trade and to organize what I may call the live stock interests of the country. Witli that object in view, along with the live stock commissioners who has been working now a little over 2 years, this work has been largely that of organization up to the present time. Mr. Hodson had shown his ability as an organizer in the province of Ontario. He had been for some time, I am speaking under correction of the official name, secretary of the lave Stock Association of the great province of Ontario, which is the centre of all the live stock interests of Canada, and I may even go fur-tner and say of all the live stock interests of this North American continent. Mr. Hodson had had that experience, and knowing him as I did, I believed his services would be of great value all over the Dominion. He has been travelling about a good deal, meeting with live stock men in other provinces as well as in Ontario, and trying to introduce into other provinces the same kind of work that had been so successful in Ontario. I am glad to see that the people have responded very willingly, and to-day we have live stock associations, not altogether inaugurated since he came in, but certainly stimulated and vivified, and rendered more effective in consequence of his work. The live stock associations of British Columbia, the Territories, Manitoba, and Ontario, and the breeders associations in the maritime provinces, not only have been individually and locally stimulated, but they have been brought into relations with one another, and a large inter-provincial
trade has sprung up, which live stock men say is of great value to them. Ontario is the breeding place of the live stock interests of Canada. Ontario men a few years ago, were comparatively glutted with their own production, and they had not such a good market as they desired. That market to-day has been found for them to a large extent in the west and in the east by reason of the institution of the live stock associations, as well as through the arrangements that have been made to facilitate the carriage of live stock eastwards and westwards. The people of Ontario have been able to make enormous sales of their live stock to Manitoba, the Territories, and British Columbia on the one hand, and to Quebec, the maritime provinces, and Newfoundland on the other hand. This is largely work which Mr. Hodson has been doing, that is the line he has been taking, and which has resulted in the advantages I have just mentioned.
In connection with that I may say that we have very much increased what I may call our participation as a Dominion department in the institute work of the various provinces. Besides doing this work and making experiments in various lines it is absolutely necessary that this work and these experiments should be given to the people and brought right home to them so that they may reap the benefit of them and understand them. We have done this in the past by issuing reports and bulletins which have been spread broadcast' throughout the country, but, as is well known by those who are familiar with agricultural problems and work, by personal contact, the holding of meetings, and the impressing upon the people through personal addresses the results of our investigations and experiments, the work is more interesting to the people, more likely to attract their- attention and more likely to induce them to carry on the work themselves until these same results have been obtained. Consequently, we have to a considerable extent aided hi the local institute work. In Ontario that work is so admirably organized and so complete that we have not had to do a great deal there although we have done some. It was just beginning in New Brunswick, but in Nova Scotia and Prince-Edward Island it was hardly organized at all. I am glad to say that to-day, and I venture to claim some credit for having, by advice, incitement and work, helped to bring about that result, they have pretty well completed the organization of that institute work iu Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and the same is true of Prince Edward Island. In the west a great deal has been done of this kind of work. They had a , stock-breeders' association and a horse-breeders' association in the territories. They were, however, working at a great disadvantage without any touch between them and other organizations of the kind, and they were rather disheartened, but to-day,

25S4
they arq, encouraged, stimulated and confident and this has been very largely due to work which Mr. Hodson has been able to do in helping them, advising them, and encouraging them in their work. TJntil we went out to..British Columbia between one and two years ago, the farmers of British Columbia were hardly in touch with the farmers of the eastern part of Canada at all, but since that visit there has sprung up an enormous trade between Ontario and the far west. X will get, before I -finish this item, a short statement of the amount of stock that has been sold there. Since the 1st of January last, I think I am correct when I make the statement that the sale of $60,000 worth of stock has been arranged by the efforts of Mr. Hodson alone independently altogether of any other purchases or sales with which he had nothing to do of stock from Ontario to British Columbia and the North-west Territories.

Their live stock interests seemed to be almost dead and they were not pushing ahead at all, but lately they have been trying to get live stock as they have seen an opening in the markets for it. Anything that they did get in the past they got from the south of the line. There were a few odd shipments of stockers from Ontario to the North-west Territories and British Columbia until the last year and a half, but during the last year and a half there has been a constant stream, not only of pure-bred animals for breeding purposes, but of stockers which have been bought in Ontario and shipped to the west for the purpose of feeding them and then re-selling them as finished animals. That trade has sprung up, and has been the direct result of bringing into contact the people in the east with the people of the west, and which but for this would probably have gone on in the old limited way in which the trade was going on. Then Mr. Hodson has started one or two good movements which are of value to the country. He has worked in conjunction with the farmers of Ontario in the improvement and the large increase of what is known as the Eat Stock Show at Guelph. This takes place every December, and I will venture to call it the great gathering of the agricultural interests of Canada every year, especially those connected with the live stock interests. Men go there from all over the country. They have there large audiences gathered together.

Mr. FISHER.,Minister of Agriculture,SUPPLY.,,,"the reasons why such an animal is goochand such another animal is bad. This work has had a tremendous educative influence and it has been giving very great results from the fact that the institute workers from the province of Ontario and from the other provinces as well have been brought there and heard these addresses, have seen these animals, have mixed with one another and exchanged experiences and ideas. These men to-day are going all over the Dominion of Canada and carrying the results of what they heard at that great gathering to the people. This part of the show was organized by Mr. Hodson. For the last two years he has, with my approval and concurrence, managed practically the addresses and the gathering together of the people at this fair. In addition this winter we have organized and stimulated and worked up a similar fair at Amherst, N.S., for the benefit of the maritime provinces. We had a most successful gathering there exactly similar to the great show at Guelph, and it is an augury for the future of the live stock interests of the maritime provinces that the town of Amherst passed a by-law devoting $12,000 to the erection of buildings for the continuance of this fair, so that it is an assured thing that such a fair will be in existence in the maritime provinces in the future as that which is in existence at Guelph. Mr. Hodson has inaugurated another work which will be of the greatest benefit to the- country. That is in connection with the ordinary agricultural society exhibitions throughout the country. There has been great difficulty in regard to these exhibitions in getting competent judges, judges who were known and whose judgments would be accepted. Mr. Hodson has undertaken to help the agricultural societies to get these gentlemen. We have spent some little money in my department for this purpose. We have been able to send men who are recognized as authorities on different lines of stock. Mr. Hodson has been able to inaugurate another thing which I believe is going to be of the greatest benefit and importance, and it is the system of the judges giving to the people who are assembled to see their judgment the reasons for their judgment and explaining why it is that one animal deserves the prize and the other does not. That has been done to a certain extent last fall, and it was a remarkable success; so successful indeed that the officers of these societies have been urging on us that it should be continued. In this way, and in other ways that are contemplated. Mr. Hodson's work will render these agricultural exhibitions much more beneficial to the people.
The next division is what I might call the dairy division. It comprises the work at headquarters ; the work of running the creameries in the North-west Territories ; the work of the assistant dairy commissioner in the province of Quebec ; the grant

to the dairy school at St. Hyacinthe and to the Dairymen's Association ; the running of three creameries in Nova Scotia ; hell) to the dairy school at Sussex, New Brunswick ; and the employment of an officer to help dairying interests in the maritime provinces. It includes also the cheese curing rooms which I have already described. That takes $62,000 out of our whole grant.
The last division is the fruit division. It includes the general work at Ottawa in connection with fruit ; and the work in connection with the Fruit Marks Act which necessitated the appointment of some inspectors. It includes the experimental work, and the advice and assistance which is given in the packing of fruit, as well as to methods to secure that the fruit shall be free from spots and as fine as possible. Last season, the first season of the operation of the Fruit Marks Act, after careful consideration and consultation with those interested in the trade, we thought it best not to proceed too rigidly with the enforcement of the Act. It was an entirely new departure, and a good many people thought that the provisions of the law were extremely strict. For my own part I believe that any one who does not live up to the provisions of that Act deserves very little sympathy. At the same time the trade of the country being already well established on certain lines, a rigid enforcement might have involved consequences which it would be as well to avoid. I gave instructions to my officers to bring to the attention of those interested, the provisions of the Act and the methods in which we proposed to enforce it, so as to give them fair warning. There were doubts expressed as to the meaning of certain clauses and I consulted lawyers and got their opinions, and then tried to impress on the packers and shippers what these opinions were. 1 may say that the passage of that Act has contributed materially to an improvement in the packing of our fruit. I regret that I cannot say that last year there was not a great deal of fruit packed which was contrary to the'provisions of the Act. But, at the same time there was an effort on the part of packers and shippers to try and live up to its provisions. At first we did not undertake to impose penalties, but we found that some people were continuing in their old ways and we afterwards did impose a few penalties chiefly as a warning, and to show that the Act could be effectively enforced. We have been all the time giving information as to the nature of the Act and endeavouring to get people to comply with its provisions. Last year our inspectors have been extremely busy throughout the season doing this work. The services of these inspectors have been required for a longer period than I had expected, but I think we are in a position now to lay off one or two. An important feature of this work Is our endeavour to explain to fruit growers how they can avoid the growing of spotted and wormeaten fruit, so that next year it is hoped that our fruit will be better in quality than in the past. That will make the enforcement of the Act easier in the coming year. What is more important still, it will bring our apples up to the high reputation which Canadian apples should enjoy in the foreign market, and it will contribute much to the benefit of the trade, generally. Our inspectors did not attempt to inspect all the shipments of fruit, but they examined 33,000 barrels in Montreal up to the 1st of December last. It would be a physical impossibility for any reasonable number of inspectors to inspect all the fruit sent to Montreal, and it was not intended under the Act that this should be done. We have also had inspectors travelling around the country inspecting fruit which was not sent to the port of Montreal. We have had demands for more extensive inspection, and especially for inspection in different localities. To what extent it is possible to meet these demands I am not now prepared to say. We hope to do a good deal more of that work this season than last season, and I believe it will contribute to the improvement of the fruit sent to the home market, just as much as what we have done this year has contributed to the improvement of our fruit for the export trade.

No person shall sell, supply, bring or send to a cheese or butter manufactory, or the owner or manager thereof, to be manufactured, milk diluted with water, or in any way adulterated, or milk from which any cream' has been taken, or milk commonly known as ' skimmed milk,' without distinctly notifying, in writing, the owner or manager of such cheese or butter manufactory, that the milk so soli, supplied or brought to bo manufactured has been so diluted with water, or adulterated, or had the cream so taken from it, or become milk commonly known as 'skimmed milk,' as the case may be. 51 v.c. 32 s.l; 55 v.c. 53 s. 1 (1).
T. No person who in the course of his business agrees to sell, supply, bring or send to any cheese or butter manufactory, or the owner or manager thereof, to be manufactured, the milk of any cow or cows, shall, in the course of such dealing and business, keep back any part of the milk of such cow or cows, without distinctly notifying, in writing, the owner or manager of such cheese or butter manufactory what portion of the milk be has so kept back.
8. No person shall sell, supply, bring or send to a cheese, or butter manufactory, or the owner or manager thereof, to be manufactured, any milk that is tainted or partly sour without distinctly notifying, in writing, the owner or manager of such cheese or butter manufactory of or such milk being tainted or partly sour.
The said sections 6, 7 and 8, shall not apply where the person charged with the offence proves to the satisfaction of justice or justces of the peace that the commission of the alleged offence was without his knowledge or privity, and contrary to his wish and intention, and that he was not aware thereof.
Chapter 43 of the Dominion statutes 52 Victoria provides as follows
1.	No person shall sell, supply or send to any cheese or butter or condensed milk manufactory, or to the owner or manager thereof, or to any maker of butter, cheese or condensed milk, to be manufactured, milk diluted with water, or in any way adulterated or milk from which any cream has been taken, or milk commonly known as skimmed milk.
2.	No person who supplies, sends, sells or brings to any cheese or butter or condensed milk manufactory, or to the owner or manager thereof, or to the maker of cheese or butter or condensed milk, any milk to be manufactured into butter or cheese or condensed milk, shall keep back any portion of that part of the milk known as strippings.
7. For the purpose of establishing the guilt of any person charged with the violation of any of the provisions or sections one or two of this Act, it shall be sufficient priiua facie evidence on which to found a conviction to show that such milk so sent, sold, supplied or brought to a manufactory as aforesaid, to be manufactured into butter or cheese or condensed milk, is substantially inferior in quality to pure milk, provided the test is made by means of a lactometer or cream gauge or some other proper and adequate test and is made by a competent person; provided always, that a conviction may be made or had on any other sufficient legal evidence.
In the one case a man who does not know that the milk was adulterated cannot be convicted, but In the other case it matters not whether he has any knowledge or not, he may be convicted. I think it is the duty of the minister to see that this mattter is made straight so that we will have but one law.

Did he say whether Mr. McKinnon had served a time as a fruitgrower sufficient to entitle him to the confidence of the people of the country, and that, after giving up fruit culture he practiced his profession as a lawyer-in other words, that Mr. McKinnon had an equipment that would entitle him to the implicit confidence that men should have in one whose duties are so important and involve so much affecting the great trade that we hope to make so much greater than it is now ?

He was brought up on a fruit farm in the Niagara district, and engaged in that work until I do not know what age. He was employed by me in my department to do certain work in preparing the fruit exhibit for the Paris Exposition. He went to Paris in connection with the fruit exhibit, and showed himself eminently qualified to attend to fruit matters. He is an educated man, with a university training, and he has also a legal education. I do not think he has ever practiced the law. He obtained his degree not very long ago-if I remember well after he returned from Paris. As I say, he is a young man. I have frequently found that young men are the most efficient officers I can get, if they have had the necessary training and education to fit them for their work. The experience I have had with Mr. McKinnon in connection with his former work and in connection with this Act, convince me that he is a most efficient officer, thoroughly well equipped for his work. It is because I believed he had the necessary qualifications that I placed him in this responsible position.

I am far from desiring to make it appear that it is a crime to be a young man, and the hon. minister will not urge that against

me. I am told that Mr. McKinnon is a young man whose father occupied a very responsible position as school inspector, but had nothing to do with fruit farming until six or seven years ago. The last six years or so, I am told, is the only time during which even Mr. McKinnon's father had any experience in fruit-growing, and I understand that it is not possible that Mr. McKinnon, jr., could have had the slightest experience, because during this whole period he was at college. Since then he has passed his examination, and, before he had time to enter upon the practice of his profession the hon. minister discovered qualities in him that caused him to send him on a trip to Paris. Now, if Mr. McKinnon has given such service as the hon. minister says, he is a very extraordinary young man, because he has succeeded in spite of not having experience or any of the qualifications required for duties of this kind. It is as well for us to 'look at this matter in a plain light. No glozing over the matter by the minister will make it appear that a man, no matter how bright he may be, can have, without experience, the qualifications for the performance of such duties as devolve upon this officer. The minister says he employed Mr. McKinnon because he was a lawyer, and that the carrying out of the law required judgment and discrimination. To use the minister's own expression, from which I do not greatly dissent, in having the Act faithfully carried out, it was thought to be as well not to be too harsh. That is what I understood the hon. minister to say.

The hon. minister must see that it is not enough to say that Mr. McKinnon served him in Paris. It is not very hard to understand that Mr. McKinnon was picked up because he was a political friend. I would like to ask the hon. minister if Mr. McKinnon is not the son of the Liberal candidate for the local legislature for the county of Lincoln. Perhaps the hon. minister is innocent of that-he is usually innocent of these things. I suppose he did not even know Mr. McKinnon's politics.
Now Mr. McKinnon has also drawn considerable sums in connection with the Paris Exposition. I see he has drawn $893.56 in some three months ; that of course includes his living allowances as well as his salary. When I turn to what is called the general expenses in connection with cold storage, I find Mr. McKinnon has drawn $510.10. I am not disposed to quarrel with the sums paid him if he has given efficient service ; but I do dissent from the position that the 82
hon. gentleman can pick up any young man or any old man in this country who is without experience, as the hon. gentleman well knows Mr. McKinnon was-for he was not even born on a fruit farm, and has not been long out of college, because I am told he is under thirty years of age now-and the very moment almost that he has passed his law examination the hon. gentleman takes him into his service. Every one knows that it is a perfect farce to allege for a moment that Mr, McKinnon ought to be given charge of duties so important. I am persuaded that the thoughtful men of this country will have little confidence in such an appointment, not because Mr. McKinnon may not be a very bright young man, but because he is without the experience necessary to discharge those duties.

I do not know of any particular reason why that fact should be a disability in my mind or in the mind of any other Liberal minister. It would be a new theory entirely in this country. But I want to tell the hon. gentleman that Mr. McKinnon was not appointed to this office because he was a Liberal ; he was appointed because I believed him to be fit for the position, and I had some little experience and knowledge of what he could do in regard to the work of preparing fruits for the Paris Exposition. I found him with some administrative capacity, and some knowledge of general affairs. I knew he had had a university training, and also a legal training ; but even if he had been without experience in practising before the courts, the legal training would be no disadvantage to him. I regret to say that in our agricultural work of this country it is not always easy to get the right man for any particular kind of work ; and I daresay my colleagues in the other departments find the same difficulty when they have some special work to be done. I have found Mr. McKinnon exceptionally bright and satisfactory, and in discussing this work with him, and knowing his antecedents, and knowing his training, I believed he would be suitable for the work. The event has well justified my choice, because I have found him very judicious and very effective in the performance of his duties, so much so in fact, that I propose to continue him in that work, or in other work that may arise in my department. I would be glad if I could attach him to the department as a permanent officer, and secure his services for the country in future. So far as his father is concerned, I am aware to-day that he is a candidate in the local elections in Ontario. I am not going to allow that to stand in the way of his son being an officer in my department. I do not think that is a valid objection, nor



do I think that, if the tables were turned, the hon. gentleman would consider that an objection.

I have no desire to minimize his position in that respect ; he has taken an active interest in that industry, and I presume as a shipper and all that. Still I think it is a question whether it is proper that Mr. McKinnon's son should be over the entire department that controls the inspection of the fruit. It would be a very difficult matter indeed, no matter how honourable the son was, to avoid giving a preference. I think there will be a feeling amongst other shippers that they will be handicapped to some extent by the fact that Mr. McKinnon's son is in a position to benefit him at the expense of others. Of course it is unfortunate that this gentleman's father Is a candidate at the present time in the Niagara district, and I would not for a moment suggest that his influence would be used there ; but I do say there will be a strong supposition that his influence will be used to the detriment of a large number of people who are engaged in that industry. I think the minister might seriously consider whether the fact of the father's connection with the Fruit Grower's Association, and the other fact of the son's connection with the inspection, will be regarded as quite satisfactory by the fruit growers of the province.

Mr. ROBINSON (Elgin.) This difficulty in regard to the inspection. The inspection would not have been needed at all. I asked the hon. minister to insert a clause providing that if apples, not according to the regulations, or apples that were rotten, were discovered, either in Europe, or any other country, in a barrel with a brand, or the packer's name or the grower's name and if three persons who purchased these apples could give prima facie evidence before a justice of the peace and this evidence were sent to Canada and to the county from which the apples were shipped, the packer or shipper might be brought before a judge and punished. Every barrel of apples cannot be inspected as every barrel cannot be opened, and if the hon. minister had accepted my proposition last year all the difficulty that has arisen would have been avoided. But, he refused to do so, and of course, he has to take the consequences.
Hon. Mr. ROSS (Victoria, N.S.) This is a strange proceeding. One hon. gentleman complains that the inspector does not know anything of fruit growing, and that he had no training in that respect. Another tells us that his father is a fruit-grower and probably an exporter of apples and on that account he thinks his son is disqualified for the position which he now occupies. That might apply to other inspectors as well as to Mr. McKinnon, because I think if they are supposed to be qualified for their positions it would be well that their fathers and themselves should have been brought up on farms and have been engaged in growing apples, because that is the very thing that would qualify them for such positions. I do not think that it would at all disqualify any one for occupying this position that he had training for it by reason of his being on an apple farm.
'Mr. BLAIN. I just wish to say that Mr. McKinnon was not brought up on a farm. His father was the public school inspector in the county which I have the honour to represent and the young gentleman was born in that county. He went to the common school there and then he w ent to college and his father was not engaged in any kind of farming whatever until he removed from our county to the county where he now resides about eight or ten years ago and went into the fruit-growing business. I think the general complaint is that the hon. minister led the House to believe last year that when this Act was put into force the gentlemen who would be appointed as inspectors would
be men of experience, men who knew something about the exporting business and who understood the fruit-growing in this country. The complaint is that the most important office, that of chief inspector for the purpose of enforcing this law, has been given to a young man of no experience whatever, not having been brought up on the farm, not having been engaged in the fruit-growing business and not having a particle of knowledge in respect to the export of apples from this country. This is the chief charge and I think it would be looked upon as being rather serious. If the hon. gentleman had appointed his father who has had six or eight years experience in growing fruit there might have been some reason wliy that gentleman should have been appointed because of his experience.

Minister of Agriculture had paid some attention to the advice tendered him we would have escaped all of this difficulty. However, as the hon. member for West Elgin (Mr. Robinson) has made his case so strong, I will have nothing to say about it. I think the objection taken by the hon. member for Halton (Mr. Henderson) is not without foundation. The hon. Minister of Agriculture knows very well that it is his duty, as it is the duty of the hon. members of this House, so far as possible for them to act, to avoid even the appearance of anything that will lead to wrong doing. I would be sorry to charge Mr. McKinnon, without personal knowledge, of having done wrong in the capacity in which he is now acting, but I want to say to the hon. Minister of Agriculture that he is open to the severest criticism. Let us take the position of Mr. McKinnon. He is to be the judge of fruit. He may come in contact with hundreds of people that may be influenced somewhat by Mr. McKinnon's conduct. Then, Mr. McKinnon is in the position of a prosecutor also. In accordance with what Mr. McKinnon says the case will be conducted. For a gentleman to be in that position he ought to be as free as possi-

ble, not only as regards himself, but so far as his associations are concerned, from any entanglements. If he is not, then he is not in a position in which he can even hope to have the confidence of the people. I am going to venture a statement in advance of any personal knowledge and it is that Mr. McKinnon was never recommended by the Fruit-growers Association of Canada, or of the province of Ontario, which would have the best possible means of knowing the person best fitted to discharge duties of that kind. My hon. friend is not open to censure for having made an appointment from his own party. That is the custom and no hon. member of this House will waste a moment in discussing it, but when the hon. member makes a party appointment and for that and no other reason, as he seems to have done in this case, he is open to censure. The Minister of Agriculture cannot tell this committee that he had a personal knowledge of Mr. McKinnon's qualifications. In any service at all, whether in law or in the knowledge of fruit, a man cannot possibly have knowledge unless he has experience and training. You might as well say that a bright young man would make a good lawyer without passing a single examination, as to say that a young man was fitted to be an inspector of fruit because his father bought a fruit farm while he was at college. The hon. gentleman says that he found this young man to be very useful, but he should have taken precaution to discover that before appointing him. Mr. McKinnon may know more about fruit than before he went to Paris, but it is perfectly clear that the Minister of Agriculture placed an inexperienced lawyer in charge of an agricultural branch, and that his doing so might have very disastrous results to the trade. I am not attacking lawyers.

If the Mimstei of Justice was able to go a little further, he would be still more in line with the Minister of Agriculture who says that this young man is qualified because his father owned a fruit farm ; carrying out the same idea, the Minister of Justice might appoint some person to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada because that person's father had owned a law library. Whatever Mr. McKinnon may develop into in the future, it is plain from the statement of the Minister of Agriculture that he had no qualification for this position when the minister appointed him.

As to his having any special qualification outside of that, he has none unless, the fact that he has studied law constitutes a qualification. I could understand, if a man had practiced law, that the knowledge of business which had come to him in that way might be of some service in a matter of this kind ; but I should think that the mere academic knowledge of law which a young
man had derived at college would confer the least possible qualification for the position assigned to this gentleman. I certainly have never found in my experience that the mere academic study of law or anything else particularly fits a man to organize or transact business such as the hon. gentleman says enters into the duties of this position. I think the hon. Minister of Agriculture has been led away by his doctrine of free trade in this matter-He desires to make the occupation of fruit-growing and a knowledge of the law reciprocate with each other. If that principle be carried out in the cabinet, it will be necessary for my hon. friend the Minister of Justice to consider the agricultural qualifications of any candidate for a seat on the bench of the Supreme Court or any of the superior courts in the provinces ; because the experience of a lawyer is about as necessary or useful to the position which the Minister of Agriculture has assigned to this gentleman as the business of fruit-growing is to the appointment of any person to a place on the bench of a court.

It appears to me that one of the best evidences that this young man is qualified is the very fact that his father is a candidate for the Local Legislature in a fruit-growing district. If the people there feared that his appointment would result in injury to the fruit-growers, that would be one of the main reasons why his father would not be a candidate for the Local House. One-half the people at any rate in that section have confidence not only in the father, but also in the son. One of the peculiar arguments brought forward to-day,
I presume with the idea of having a little sport, is the injurious effect that will follow from the fact of this inspector's father being a candidate. Now, I would like to know where our friends are going to draw the line. Are they going to exclude a main from running for the Local Legislature because his son happens to be an official of the Federal government ? Or are they going to prevent a man being appointed to any office because his father or his cousin happens to be a candidate ? How far are the ties of consanguinity going to extend ? What do these hon. gentlemen want ? Do they want the father to stop running, or the son to resign ?

This inspector has to see that such fruit shall consist ot full-grown specimens of the one variety, but how would he know there was only one variety in the barrel. It would take the best of experts to distinguish the varieties in some cases, they look so much alike. Even fruit-growers have to send their apples down to experts at Toronto to determine the varieties and the disputes that arise at agricultural fairs are often so animated that the judges themselves cannot decide to what particular variety an apple may belong, although they are men who have been all their lives raising apples in the district. But this young man who was never engaged or in the fruit business, is expected to teach fruit-growers the difference between one variety and another. He is also to determine whether the fruit packed is falsely marked, and if he finds it is, he lias to efface the mark and inscribe the words ' falsely marked.' But how can he do so if he has no experience or practical training ? Pie could not tell whether there was a mixture of two or three varieties or whether the apples were full grown. That could only be' done by some one who was in the apple-growing business or accustomed to handle and export apples. The information we have is that this young man cannot possibly have expert knowledge and therefore must be unfit for the position. The hon. member for Annapolis says he has satisfied the people in Annapolis and must therefore have satisfied the whole country. But that will not satisfy the fruit-growers and handlers who believe that the inspector ought to be expert in the line-one who can distinguish the different varieties, who knows what is a well matured apple and what is not, who knows what is an average sized apple, and who can tell when the Act has been complied with in the selection, packing and marking of the fruit. -

In the fruit trade, the export of which ranges from $2,WJO,(Xi0 to $3,-UOO.OOO per year, we have an inspector of inspectors, who, the minister tells us, never inspects the apples, but is paid a salary of $1,200 a year to see that the fruit is properly packed. The whole thing is a farce. This' man cannot possibly have the requisite knowledge because he has never had any experience in the trade, and the sooner some change is made that will give confidence to the people, the better. What confidence will the people have in the inspection law, when its administration is in the hands of one who cannot possibly have the knowledge nr experience required ? I say they will have no confidence whatever, and the people, in that way, will not respect the law.

It was stated a few days ago that this charter only covered about 2,500 miles of road. As a matter of fact, if the charter is looked into closely, it will be found that it covers fully double that amount of railway. This road runs all across the continent and twice across the continent from Winnipeg west with branch lines which will make the mileage upwards of 5,000 miles, a much greater mileage than was granted to the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. Now, there are no conditions attached to this Bill, as to the amount of road which shall be built each year, or as to the kind of rolling stock that shall be supplied. It is absolutely a blanket charter, or a roving charter, as was said by the hon. member for Alberta (Mr. Oliver) without any conditions whatever. If it is going to be the policy of this government to grant such charters and in future to continue granting them, then, let it be understood that such is their policy, but I submit, that at the present time there is no precedent for the granting of any such charter. There are some of those lines that might appear all right to eastern men who do not understand the situation, but to western men who do understand the situation, the local conditions and the geography of that country, they are simply lines running from any one point to any other point without any definition whatever. You might as well say that this company shall have power to construct a line from any one point in Canada to any other point in Canada. That is practically what the charter means. As the Bill originally appeared it authorized the company to construct a line from a point east of Edmonton to the Red Deer river. It now describes that line as running to a point between Beaver lake and Sullivan lake. When I tell hon. gentlemen that there are probably fifty Beaver lakes and fifty Sullivan lakes in the North-west Territories they will readily understand that the thing is quite indefinite. There are certain names attached to lakes such as Devil's lake which are very common in the Territories. There is nothing to show where that branch liue

Then, again, in regard to the clause providing for the capitalization of this company, I trust this committee will bear in mind that last year there was ratified here an agreement by which the province of Manitoba has guaranteed the interest on $20,000 a mile on all of the line from Port Arthur to Winnipeg, and on all of the lines in Manitoba. They stated the other day they had 1.300 miles in all. I understand that this Bill-I have not been able to go into it, and the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals (Mr. Blair) is not here- increases that liability and that the province of Manitoba will be in rather a peculiar position, that that province will not only have to guarantee interest on $20,000 a mile but that the railway will have to earn much more than that before the province of Manitoba will be safe as guarantor. I would be glad if the Minister of Finance (Hon. Mr. Fielding), or the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals, would take this matter into consideration and explain the position that the province of Manitoba will be in if this charter passes in the condition in which it is brought before the committee. The hon. member for Marquette (Mr. Roche) is here and as he is probably more conversant with the railway deal in Manitoba than I am, I would like to hear his views upon that point. I think, also, in all fairness, that subsection (e), which authorizes the company to build a branch line from some place east of Edmonton in Alberta or Saskatchewan to the Red Deer river, should be struck out. ' To some place east in Alberta or Saskatchewan.' Now. in my humble opinion that covers 300 or 400 miles. Some place east of Edmonton in Saskatchewan or Alberta would give a starting point 400 miles-to where ? In the first place it was to the Red Deer river, and as I showed the other day in committee, that was within 600 miles of the terminus. They can do that, and it is so indefinite that they can start pretty nearly at any place and end pretty nearly at any place. There is nothing to that branch line, it should be cut out. Then, again, when do you suppose that branch line could be operated ? In the first place they would have to build their line from a point near the Swan river, away north to Edmonton, and an immigrant would have to go about 300 miles out of his way to get to the point that he could get on this branch line ; the same as if I was going to Winnipeg and went to Montreal first and then took some other route to get to Winnipeg. I submit that branch line is perfectly ridiculous. The gentleman who explained this the other day, Mr. Nash, said they were going down to the Red Deer river for coal. Well, anybody who knows anything about the Red Deer river knows there is little or no coal on that river. Coal is up on the Battle river, or on the
Saskatchewan ; on the Red Deer river there is no coal. Any one can see that it is a branch line put there purely for the purpose of obstructing some other line that may run up. Now if there is one line in the North-west Territories that is required, it is a line paralleling the Calgary and Edmonton line. From Calgary to Edmonton there is about 192 miles. There have been
40,000	to 50,000 settlers located within the last four years in that district, and the consequence is that the territory on each side is taken up. both the homestead and railway land, until parties mow have to drive about 60 to 70 miles to get homesteads. They are getting discouraged, they wont go. Now the experience in the United States has been that whenever there has been a wave of immigration going into a certain territory, that territory has become popular, it has become well known. Then if you stop the immigration at a certain point, it practically stops immigration to the entire North-west. The reason why people go to Alberta instead of Assiniboia and Manitoba is this :	The idea is prevalent in
the United States among a great many people that the climate of Northern Alberta, being near the foot hills of the mountains, is much more mild than it is in Manitoba. If a man arrives at Winnipeg and you ask him where he is going to settle, he will tell you, I want to go out into Alberta, because the foot hills of the Rocky mountains will protect us and the Chinook winds moderate the climate. That is the popular opinion that prevails both among Britishers and the people of the United States : and if you stop immigrants going to that point you may stop immigration altogether.",,,,

but that is my interpretation of it. As to the powers which they have between Port Arthur and Quebec to build roads to Ottawa and Montreal, there is no starting point given, but there is a finishing point, namely, Montreal in the one case and Ottawa in the other. I objected to that, because I thought it was scarcely definite enough, but as it -related to the indefinite future when they might require to build those lines, it would not be a serious objection. Beyond that the Bill seems to be much the same, containing much the same powers, as many other Bills we have passed. I admit it is a very long line, and the charter was somewhat of a blanket character. But after all, it contains very much the same rights and powers as we have given to many other companies.

They will have to haul back and go away up to Victoria and east again.

I could understand the Canadian Pacific Railway if they were to run a line, and I think they ought, from Medicine Hat north between Alberta and Saskatchewan, but I do not understand what the Northern Company want with this line coming there and stopping there.

As a matter of fact there is a charter before this House running from Medicine Hat north and west to the Red Deer, along ridge 16-west of the fourth meridian to the Saskatchewan river. That charter goes through a territory that is now being settled by immigrants. It will connect with tlie Canadian Pacific Railway and also with the branch line running from Lethbridge to Medicine Hat. People who come from the United States via Coutts will be able to come up and go into the northern limit by this new line parallel to the Calgary and Edmonton. It is a strange thing that the Mackenzie and Mann Company never thought of applying for this charter until the other charter had been advertised for some time.
Then it dawned upon them that they would like to have a kind of branch line starting from no place and going to no place, to take the place of the line for which there is a charter before the House. A more ridiculous piece of legislation is not on the statute-book, to any man conversant with the situation, and before I sit down, I am going to move that that branch line be struck out. With regard to the bonding privilege, l am not sufficient of a lawyer or a parliamentarian to know exactly what that means-whether the $20,000 a mile is in such a shape that this company cannot recede from the bargain made with the province of Manitoba. While the bargain made by the province of Manitoba is not exactly endorsed by me, I admit that it is turning out to be a much better bargain than I anticipated. But we do not want to jeopardize that province by placing on it a burden which it never expected to bear. If this provision is going to increase the liability of the province of Manitoba one cent, hon. members should not allow it to pass; because while it is giving us relief from a monopoly, it is an expensive bargain, which will require a great deal of careful handling in the next ten years to

help us out. If we continue to have such crops as we had last year, I believe the bargain will come out all right; but this Dominion government must not place any further burdens on the province of Manitoba, or it will bring that province to a state of very serious indebtedness in the near future. I would aslt the Minister of Finance to allow the Bill to stand until the Minister of Railways is here, because he was thoroughly in touch with the Bill that came before the House last session. The Minister of Finance was only at the Railway Committee a very little time, but the Minister of Railways knows exactly what this clause means, and I would ask him to be on hand to explain it.

Everybody coming to the Saskatchewan is not coming from Montana; in fact, a very small proportion are coming from Montana. As a matter of fact, the people are coming from that portion of the United States which lies south and south-easterly from the city of Winnipeg, and it is shorter for them to come to the Saskatchewan district by way of the Canadian Northern than by the Canadian Pacific Railway. So that while I do not wish to argue for the Canadian Northern Railway Company nor for this branch line in particular, I do wish to point out that the objections which are urged against the branch line are not valid objections, and did not prevail with the Railway Committee, and that an arrangement having been agreed to in the committee, it is hardly fair to raise a contention in the House against the arrangement. The country which is to be served by this branch line is already very largely settled. There is a necessity for the construction of such a road as this; and when the Canadian Northern Railway Company propose to take the responsibility of serving a certain piece of country with a certain branch line, I do not feel warranted in taking the responsibility of opposing them.

They came in either via Coutts or via North Portal. If they came via Coutts, they struck the main line at Medicine Hat and would go by the Canadian Pacific Railway to where this new line is projected. If they came in on the Soo line via North Portal, how would they reach this line ? They would strike the main line at Moosejaw, and would have to go back 350 miles to Portage la Prairie and then

north-west 350 miles. In other words, they would have to travel 700 miles out of their way to reach this northern point on the Saskatchewan river, and then go south.

They can come in by that way now if they wish. But do they ? No, they take the Soo Line which is chiefly owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and the Canadian Pacific Railway encourage settlers to go in that way by giving a $9.60 rate from the boundary line to Edmonton, against a rate of $15 when they came in by way of Winnipeg. Moreover, they make no change of cars at the boundary line but the same cars run through from St. Paul and Minneapolis, so that settlers are not obliged to change cars or unload. The cars are owned by the same company. But if the settlers came in in a Great Northern car, when they got to the boundary line they would have to unload their settler's effects or pay something like one cent a hundred miles, which is the running rate to go to Edmonton. So, no
matter how many Canadian Northern roads we have the settlers from St. Paul or Minneapolis-that means also all western and southern points like Kansas city, Oklahoma, and so on, will take the Soo Line. As I say, the Canadian Pacific Railway favour that route. I have tried hard, and the Manitoba government has tried hard to get immigrants to come in by way of Winnipeg, so that they could get them into Manitoba and up on the Manitoba and Northwestern route, but they have not succeeded in doing so, because they have more favourable rates on a better train service by the other way. There is no change of cars or waiting over as at Winnipeg. A man and his family coming into Winnipeg at two o'clock cannot get a train going west until the next day. What does that mean ? A man may have a family of seven or eight children and he will have to take them up town, and it will cost him $10 or $15 for a hotel bill for his family. But, on the Soo Line he will start from St. Paul and get to his destination without change of cars.

I may tell the hon. gentleman (Mr. Oliver) that, even though I do not live in Edmonton I know the situation there so far as immigration is concerned, probably as well as he does. I had a great deal more to do with the settling of that country than he had. I have visited the immigrants there over and over again, and have had the question of immigration before me every day for three years and a half. That is why i asked the government two or three years ago-and my letters are on file in the Department of the Interior-to urge the Canadian Pacific Railway to construct this line for immigrants.
I did it as a civil servant then in what I believed to be the best interest of the public, and I do the same as a member of parliament to-day. I say this is the only practical way to build the line.

I had some correspondence withi the immigration agent in the province of Manitoba in the United States, and he drew my attention to the fact that discriminatory rates are charged in favour of the ' Soo ' line.

The seven that are temporary are not employed by the year, the other three or four are employed permanently. Any person who is conversant with the fruit business knows that their time will not be fully taken up; but he proposes to send them around as active agents ostensibly to talk fruit business generally over the country, and perhaps they will talk something else in the interest of the ministers. Now we have an Agriculture Committee which meets twice or three times a week; that committee has had before it Professor Robertson and the head of the Immigration Department, and two or three other heads of departments. Now. I suggest to the minister that at the next meeting of the Agriculture Committee he should have Mr. McKinnon, the chief officer of this inspection department, there, and then the committee will catechise him and ascertain his qualifications, and the qualifications, of these gentlemen who are under him. and the amount of work that has been done during the last year while this department has been in full swing.

It is rather discouraging and casts doubt and suspicion upon the value of cold storage as it is yet worked out. I think the hon. gentleman will agree with me that cold storage is in its experimental stage to a very considerable extent. It has not been put beyond all question so far, although, I may say there is a disposition, and a very strong one to, if possible, make cold storage a great success. The hon. gentleman has been forced, perhaps, to have it somewhat experimental all through. It seems to me that the greatest care should be taken that when perishable goods are sent as an experiment the first condition should be that they are properly received.

The meat was not hung in the compartments, but packed on its side like cordwood. I believe that under certain circumstances and conditions, if the meat is perfectly cool when it is put in and kept cool, that can be done, but in this particular instance in which this one shipment failed, the meat was known not to be perfectly cool when it was put in the cold storage chamber of the ship.

He is a practical farmer, and has devoted a great deal of time and energy in promoting the agricultural interests of the country ; and I am grateful to the Prime Minister for having selected a gentleman from the eastern townships, from which I come, to fill the important Department of Agriculture.

Of late there has been evident a concerted attack on the part of the Conservative leaders and press upon the Minister of Agriculture and his work for the farmer. This is undoubtedly due to the discovery by these gentlemen of the feeling existing amongst the farmers of Canada that much has been done in their interests by the Liberal government and minister, and they are so frightened by this feeling amongst the electorate that they find it necessary to try to counteract it.

There is another matter which I wish to bring to his attention. It has to do with the inspection of fruit. I find that while we have it stated here that Mr. McKinnon is a very competent gentleman, a fraudulent shipment has been made to Prince Edward Island. Although we shipped fruit from the island, yet our merchants to a certain extent, import fruit from the other provinces in their general line of business.
I find in the Charlottetown ' Patriot ' of April 9th, which is the latest date we have on file in the reading room, the following comment:
The usefulness of having a fruit inspector in this province has been practically demonstrated. During the absence of Mr. Burke, in the other provinces, a shipment of apples was received in Charlottetown from a Montreal firm. The apples were originally packed in Ontario. The packer's name was erased by the Montreal firm and their own firm name substituted. On his return to the island, Mr. Burke, in the course of his inspection, discovered that this lot of apples was fraudulently packed by the barrels being faced with No. 1 fruit while below the surface the veriest trash appeared. Mr. Burke at once made complaint against the Montreal shippers and had a fine imposed under the Trade Marks Act.
Well, Mr. Chairman, if this gentleman of all the talents-half lawyer and half fruitgrower-in Ontario had been attending to his duties there, that shipment would not have been made to Prince Edward Island. We are charged with criticising this gentleman because his father is a candidate for a certain riding in Ontario at the local elections. We are doing nothing of the kind, but I believe that if you would sift the matter out, you would find that this lot of apples came from that very Niagara district where his father is running, and where he is intrusted with the inspection of fruit, and no doubt in order to gain favour for his father in the elections, he allowed this fraudulent shipment of apples to he sent to the island. I know nothing about Mr. McKinnon, and if he be a young man and has the ability hon. gentlemen opposite
say he has, I am satisfied. I would rather give a young man a push forward than try to keep him down. But if we find such a fraudulent shipment coming from Ontario, under the immediate supervision and inspection of this gentleman, I would ask tlie minister does he think that this inspector is after all so efficient. It may be impossible for him to inspect every barrel of apples, hut the names of those parties in Ontario who shipped that fruit and the name of the Montreal firm which erased the shipper's name and substituted their own, should be made public, so that the public may judge whether the Trade Marks Act is being carried out as effectively as the hon. gentleman represents.

As I explained before dinner, this is an experiment which, so far as I know, has never been tried in any cheesemaking country in the world. It has been projected because of what are considered to be the necessities of the case, and will involve the adoption of what are judged to be the best means of meeting those difficulties and overcoming them. We trust and believe, and the representative cheese-makers in the dairying associations have
tUUuiScL uiO	>.	-	-a-	vJ.j *-yj Jv,
a successful experiment. It is not being done for the purpose of helping the particular localities that have been chosen for the work. These localities have been chosen because they seem to be distinctly cheesemaking centres, where these curing establishments and the experiments carried on in them will be under the observation of those engaged in the industry. The places chosen are Woodstock, in western Ontario, Brockville in eastern Ontario; St. Hyacinthe for the French parts of the province of Quebec, and Cowansville for the English speaking parts. The general results will be published as they are learned; and if, at the end of the season those results meet

tiie expectations of those who are interested, I trust and believe that the cheesemaking centres of the country will adopt the system for themselves and carry it out in a commercial way. There is no intention on the part of the government to do this work all over the country. We shall follow the precedent set iu the case of what is called winter dairying. Under my predecessor, Professor Robertson inaugurated in Ontario and Prince Edward Island, and also, I tliiuk, in Nova Scotia, winter dairying stations, where butter was made on a considerable scale throughout the winter for the purpose of showing the butter-makers that butter could so be made as well as in summer. Certain localities were chosen because they seemed to be suitable for the experiments. So in this case. The hon. gentleman asked me how it would be worked. Without going into details, I may say generally that we are putting up a building which will be arranged so that we can control the temperature in the curing room, where the cheese will be kept. We also hope to have, in one or two of the buildings at all events, several small chambers where we can try experiments in curing cheese at different temperatures within the range that experiments in New York State and Guelph have shown to be the best. We also expect to box the cheese, and I trust and expect that our work in that respect will lead to improvement throughout the country. The boxing of our cheese, up to the present time, has not been all that we could desire. For many years the defects iu this respect have caused a serious loss annually. Arrangements will be made to bring in cheese from the factories which are to supply them to the central curing room. The cheese will be brought in immediately after it is made up in the presses-probably the next day after it is taken out of the press.

The cheese will be placed on the shelves in the central curing room and will then be under the control and management of the expert in charge of the building. We do not know yet exactly how long the curing process will take, but we have a pretty fair idea. When the cheese is cured and declared ready for market, it will be at the disposal of its owners, the people who supplied it. We have no control of the sale of it or of the commerce in it. The cheese may be left iu the central curing room for a short time, we do not know exactly how long. But I do not think that these central curing rooms ought to be used as a sort of keeping warehouse for the cheese. If they were kept there for a long time the accumulation of cheese would make it necessary to increase Hon. Mr. FISHER.
the size of the building and spend money iu the care of the cheese. That is a business for an ordinary warehouse properly epuipped. We are satisfied-in fact we know from our experiments-that cheese will shrink very much less In these curing rooms than in the ordinary curing rooms in the factories. And we know also, as well as we can know anything in the future, that cheese cured in these central establishments will be worth considerably more than if cured in the old rooms under varying temperatures running sometimes as high as 85 or even 90 degrees Farenlieit. We know also that cheese cured in this way can be made softer and moister, that is, the maker will be able to make more pounds of cheese to every hundred pounds of milk than under the present system of curing. Therefore, the profit in the business will be threefold; first, a given quantity of milk will make more cheese; second, the cheese will shrink less in the curing room and so will weigh out more when it comes to be sold; and, third, the price of cheese will be better than if cured under the ordinary conditions. The buildings we propose to make in a substantial manner, in a way which may, I trust, be a model in the future for the buildings put up by companies or individuals for similar purposes. In the course of the summer's work we shall probably find many details which will have to be changed from our present plan. But we believe we have outlined the plan as well as can be done without (practical experience. For this is a pure experiment from the word ' go.' I trust that at the end of the season we shall be able to make a report to the cheese-makers of Canada which will enable them to go on to do this work for themselves as successfully as they do other work in connection with this great cheese-making industry.

The following is a comparison during the last four years und""r Conservative rule and the last four years under the Liberal administration.
It gives the quantity of butter exported for the years 1893, 1894, 1895 and 1S96 ; and then for the four years under Liberal administration of 1897, 1898, 1899 and 1900. I do not know how he could publish and distribute this book in 1900, when he professes to include the exports of these four articles in 1900. It could not be until after 1900 that the hon. gentleman could gather the statistics and publish them. In another table he gives a comparative statement of the expenditure under four years of Conservative administration and four years of Liberal administration, including 1901. He is trying to prove to the farmers that he is doing more for them in the expenditure of money under these heads than the Conservative government did. So this document must certainly have been sent out to the farmers since 1901, or else he is trying to impose upon them. He can take whichever horn of the dilemma he chooses.

The MINISTER OF xVGRICULTURE. If these results were such as the hon. member for South Leeds (Mr. Taylor) has stated them there is no doubt that it would not be very profitable. As a matter of fact, the expenditure which the hon. gentleman fctatcd as the expanse on these particular lots of chickens included the establishment of the stations, and the experimental and educational work which these men were carrying on. Prof. Robertson gave the details in connection with these shipments every year before the Agriculture Committee of the House and they are published in the annual report of the department and these details show that the price of these chickens in England is about double the cost that is incurred here. As a matter of fact a number of men whom we started in this work and who at first did experimental work, such as Mr. Brant and Mr. McBean are doing to-day, are doing this work themselves now. They have left the work of the department and are no longer
doing it but have entered into business on a commercial basis and are making it pay. The results are also evident from the fact that in 1896, before this work commenced, our whole export of chicken meat to Great Britain was about $18,000 and that during this last session it amounted to $220,000. To-day our chicken exporters say that they will take all the fatted chickens they can get and pay ten cents a pound for them in the centres where they are working. They are sending them forward and making a profit on them and they are doing this business on a large scale.

Joking apart, it may be possible that the fattening industry would become of some importance as a by product of the farm in the province of Prince Edward Island. Mr. Gilbert, from the Experimental Farm, was in the Island last year, and he really did some very practical work, and by his addresses to the farmers he showed them, I think, that they might increase their revenue by poultry raising. I want to have it understood, however, that as a government proposition It has been a complete failure in the province of Prince Edward Island. Mr. Gilbert or a gentleman like him who so- thoroughly understands the chicken business can do a great deal of good by explaining to the farmers how to raise these chickens, the best breeds to raise, and how to place them on the market in the best shape.

For some time the government had been issuing bulletins advising the farmers to take up the fattening of chickens as a profitable by-product, and adjunct of their general farming business. But those who had tried it up to the time the government started these experimental stations, did not seem to have made a success of it. When the station was started at Lancaster, an official came down from the Experimental Farm, and he showed us how to do the work. He showed the young men how to go through the mixing and feeding and the methods of taking care of the chickens, and the result has been that dozens of people have taken this up as a part of their business in the county of Glengarry, and have found it very profitable. I could give a number of names of prominent men who have taken the business up in connection with their farming. For instance, there is Mr. Macdonald, in the village of Glengarry, who has fitted up for this purpose a part of his stables, which he had been using for fattening cattle. And he told me a short time ago that he intended using another stable for chicken fattening, and drop the feeding of cattle' as a business to that extent.

They undertook the chicken business and the chickens got sick and died. But still the minister asserts that it has been a very profitable business. The hon. minister proves to the country by his own failures that his administration is a marked success in every respect. I cannot see the logic of it, and it seems to me that if the hon. gentleman would frankly admit his failures, the country would take that admission in the proper spirit. We all know that the work is largely experimental and must expect failure in some instances, but the hon. gentleman has an excuse in every case and makes out that he is infallible. I hardly think he will persuade the country to take this view of his administration. I did not quite understand the hon. gentleman's statement with regard to the cheese-curing stations, but I drew from it that a different kind of cheese is now required, somewhat softer in texture, aud which cannot be cured by the old process. But there can be no doubt that Canadian cheese attained great success many years ago before this process

was thought of, and I would like the hon. gentleman to explain why he suggests the manufacture of a different class of cheese requiring a different treatment from the cheese we made in the past and which met with such success.

It is impossible to send such cheese successfully forward in heated ships or to cure it successfully in a heated room. For that reason we have been trying to get ventilated holds for the ships to carry it in and to get curing rooms where it can be successfully cured. We have not been able to make that cheese in Canada because v e had not properly constructed cheese factories. We have explained that to the people for three or four years back and have experimented to see whether that kind of cheese could be made in a cooler chamber. Our experiments show that it can be, and that there was nothing 'nherent in the Canadian climate or soii to prevent our making it. By a series of experiments extending over a couple of years, we have been trying to find the caus>' of the difficulty and a remedy for it. And we think that, to a certain extent we are likely to attain the object desired. There is no doubt that the cheese that went forward in the four ships I have referred to arrived in much better condition than others. We have the reports of the receivers, and also resolutions passed by the shippers, and resolutions passed by the produce dealers in London, declaring that they wished all cheese carried in this way. But I do not think the remedy will be complete until the place in which the cheese is to be cured can be kept at a low enough temperature. The ordinary curing room in the country is not of that construction. We have tried for a couple of years to get the people to change their curing rooms, but they have simply ignored the advice. In a few instances they may have adopted it, but so few tn.'.t it has made no impression upon the market.

I understand that there is a largely signed petition in the department of the hon. minister asking that Mr. Sharp be appointed to do the work of pruning and grafting. Mr. Sharp is a Liberal, a personal friend of mine, though a strong political opponent, but he has beeu in the nursery business for a long number of years, and he is thoroughly conversant with the cultivation of fruit trees. In view of the fact that the hon. minister has a memorial in his hands signed by a large proportion of the people engaged in that industry in Prince Edward Island, I hope he will pay some attention to it. We do not want to have a repetition of Kinsman coming over there from Nova Scotia. Mr. Sharp is a nurseryman who has been selling his trees to the farmers of Prince Edward Island for a long number of years. I think he represents a' nursery situated somewhere in the vicinity of Sussex, and he deals in trees that are suitable for Prince Edward Island. He has taken a deep interest in the cultivation of these trees. He goes around as far as he possibly can, being a man who is dependent for his living on the work he is doing, assisting the parties to whom he has sold trees in the cultivation of them. But he cannot give his whole time and attention to that without some compensation from the government and I would, therefore, as far as I can in this parliament, make known the capabilities of Mr. Sharpe and his thorough knowledge of and acquaintance with orchard work in Prince Edward Island. I would like to ask the hon. minister, having this memorial signed by a large number of the people of Prince Edward Island, that he would be good enough to pay some attention to it.

Prof. Robertson came down to Prince Edward Island under the Conservative government and established these cheese factories, and they have been a great success. The cheese industry lias been a success there without any assistance from this government, only that they rented this cold storage room from the Rattenburys, friends of their own in Charlottetown. The least the government ought to do is to build one of those cheese curing establishments in Prince Edward Island. The minister tells us that when the cheese is treated in one of those places it will come out perfect and be worth from three to four cents a pound more than ordinary cheese. Why should not the people of every province have the benefit of them. Why build two in Ontario and two in Quebec and not build any in New Brunswick. Nova Scotia. Prince Edward Island and Manitoba. We should have in the province of Erince Edward Island this means of turning the dairy products of the people to ' the best advantage. I trust the minister

will see his way clear to establish one of these places in Prince Edward Island.

Eight of these factories out of twenty-one have repaid the whole of the advances, four others have paid very nearly all, and I am certain will entirely repay next season if there is anything like the work that has been done lately. There are a few which I fear will lose money. These are, Edmonton and its tributaries, Maple Creek, Prince Albert and Duck Lake, and Wolseley and Moffat. The others owe much smaller amounts and it is likely they will be able to pay off. After all that is not a bad showing although I confess that the anticipations have not been realized as far as the actual financial view is concerned.
