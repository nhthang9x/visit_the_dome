39226,ca.proc.d.1902-04-29.2.1.1,1902-04-29,,,,stagedirection,,,,"The POSTMASTER GENERAL (Hon. Wm. Mulock) moved for leave to introduce a Bill (No. 146) for the settlement of railway labour disputes. He said : The object of this Bill is to prevent lockouts and strikes upon railways by providing a more satisfactory way than those violent measures afford for the settlement of such disputes, and of differences as from time to time arise between railway companies and their employees. Although this is hardly the occasion for any lengthened observations, still as the measure is somewhat novel, perhaps a few words now would not be out of place. I would say that the proposition is in fact one for compulsory arbitration between railway companies and their employees in regard to the various subjects of contx-oversy that from time to time arise between those parties. The measure is confined entirely to the railway world, it does not deal with any other than railway industries, and therefore it is not a precedent for the ti-eatment of disputes between other classes. Railway companies, -it is to be remembered, occupy a unique position. Whilst strikes and lockouts upon railways affect the companies and their employees, there is a third interest to be considered, the public interest, perhaps the greatest of all, and that paramount interest appears to give jurisdiction on this occasion for the House to adopt what is apparently an extreme means in order to ward off the evil consequences flowing from railway strikes and lockouts. It is unnecessary to point out what those consequences are, they are apparent to all. When a strike takes place upon a railway the road falls iixto disrepair, the traffic is less safe, the travelling public and the train hands alike suffer and run greater risks. Delays in transportation of goods are moi'e fi'equent, and at times the strike culminates in a cessation of the operations of the railway.
Railways are the creatures of parliament,
they are created in the public interest, and for that reason they are given rights paramount to those of the individual. They are created to serve the public, in the first place, and it is the duty of the people's representatives to see that the object of parliament in granting charters is not defeated, either by the company or by their employees. Last winter there was a wheat blockade in the North-west Territories. We are told that, partial as was the interruption of the railway on that occasion, it caused a very considerable public loss. What would have been the consequences to Canada, if the Canadian Pacific Railway, instead of a partial failure of service on that occasion, had been unable to turn a wheel for a week ? It would have wrought, doubtless, widespread disaster to our country, yet such a contingency is always possible so long as there is ' no satisfactory tribunal for promoting friendly relations between companies and their men, and settling the labour disputes that are always arising between i-ailway companies and their employees. Sooner or later strikes and lockouts lead to arbitration. Why not sooner rather than later ? This measure proposes to substitute the provisions of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, for the present procedure of a strike or a lockout. The measure provides for the establishment of a tribunal equipped with ample powers for the settlement of all these questions. It is proposed to apply its provisions xxot merely to railways operating under Dominion, but also to those operating under provincial charters, and it will also be made applicable to the Intercolonial Railway and to any railways owned by provinces, with the consent of the governments of those provinces. It will apply to a railway operated by steam, electricity or any other motor power. The range of subjects that may be referi*ed is only limited by the variety of the subjects of dispute arising between railway companies and their employees. The ""measure declares that strikes and lockouts shall be illegal, and it provides penalties for the contravention of these provisions. For the settlement of disputes there will be provincial boards of arbitration to deal with these questions if they are of a provincial character, but if they are more far-reaching than provincial, then, they will be dealt with by a Dominion board. The different provincial boards will be equipped with a clerk, who will be the medium of communication between the parties to the controversy and the board, and who will perform the clerical duties proper to his position. Each provincial board will be composed of three ai'bitra-tors, one to be chosen by the railway companies of the province, or operating within the province, according to a scale of voting that is provided in the Act, another to be",,,,
39227,ca.proc.d.1902-04-29.2.1.2,1902-04-29,,,,stagedirection,,,,"eliosen by the men, and the third arbitrator to be chosen by these two, or failing their making a choice, then by the Governor in Council. For the purposes of this measure the North-west Territories are deemed to be a part of the province of Manitoba, and there being seven provinces, there will be seven local boards. The railway companies will elect one arbitrator to each of these seven boards, the employees will elect another arbitrator to each provincial board, and these two will elect a third, or in default the Governor in Council will appoint the third arbitrator. Thus you will have seven arbitrators representing the railway companies, seven employees' arbitrators, and seven arbitrators appointed by the government. In the event of the subject of dispute being more than a local one, it will be dealt with by the Dominion board. The Dominion board will consist of five members, two to be chosen out of the seven elected by the railway companies, two out of the seven elected by the employees, and the fifth to be chosen by the four, or failing their making a choice, then, by the Governor in Council. It will l>e the duty of this board, in the first instance, to be conciliatory and to endeavour to arrange a settlement of all matters in dispute. Failing in their efforts in that direction, the board is clothed with ample powers to proceed as arbitrators and to determine the questions referred to it and make an award. The award of the chairman and one other member of the board, being a provincial board, will be the award of the board. The award of the chairman and two other members, in the case of the Dominion board, will be the award of the board. The award of the board will be current for such time, not exceeding a year, as the award states, with a provision, however, that either party to the dispute may terminate it within a lesser period, but nevertheless, the award, when made, will continue in effect until another award has been made to take its place. It will not be permitted to any of the parties to the dispute to appear by counsel or professional gentlemen before the arbitrators unless by Consent of both par ties and of the arbitrators themselves. The award itself will not be cognizable in any court, and it shall not be removable to a court by certorari or in any other way for the purpose of amendment or of being quashed. In reference to the mode of election of provincial boards, the following is the proposal :	There will be at
Ottawa, an officer, to be called the registrar, whose duty it will be from time to time to prepare the election registers. The duration of a provincial board will be three years, the elections being triennial, unless a vacancy shall occur, in which case there is provision for a by-election. A voters' list will be made up for the railways, and Hon. Mr. MULOCK.
another for the employees, each railway operating within the province, being given as many votes in the election of its arbitrator as it has employees within the province. In regard to the employees, each employee in the province will have one vote. There will be two distant registers, the railways voting as one class and electing their representative on the board, and the men voting as one class and electing their representative on the board. They will vote by voting papers to be transmitted to the registrar, and these papers will be opened on a day named. There is provision for nomination and the usual machinery for the holding of such an election. In the event of a railway company. or other party, refusing to abide by the award, the measure provides penalties, and the last clause declares that these provisions shall apply to the government of Canada in refcpect to the Intercolonial Railway and to consenting provincial governments in respect to any railways which they may own and operate, and that the award shall be binding on the, respective governments.",,,,

That I presume will take that class of industry altogether out of the operation of the Conciliation Act. I may say that I consider this Bill to be a very important measure indeed.
It seems to me that this is perhaps the most serious attempt along this line of industrial legislation that has ever been introduced into this parliament. I think we can congratulate ourselves, as well as the Minister of Labour, that all interests likely to be affected by this legislation are now in a position to fairly consider the measure: and that there is no antagonism at present between the parties in this country who will come under the scope of this Act. We may congratulate ourselves that there is also in Canada a decided leaning towards the progress of conciliation and arbitration, and that seeing that the Bill is not going to be pressed this session, we may in the meantime have the Bill fully considered by those parties who are interested. In 1900, when the Conciliation Act was introduced, I then was bold enough to say that I did not agree to the principle of voluntary conciliation; that I did not think we were justified in going to the trouble of passing a voluntary Conciliation Act of that kind. I went on record as being absolutely in favour of giving the principle of compulsory arbitration a trial. Since that time I have freely acknowledged that there has been some good accomplished by the Conciliation Act, and for my part, I have always been ready to assist it. I am pleased to say that the Conciliation Act has done some good, but at the same time I have not in any way revised my opinion that is is the most ineffective method we could take to deal with the very numerous cases of labour disturbances of one kind or another, that are bound to occur in this country as well as in other countries. I believe that a proper understanding and a proper application of the principle of compulsory arbitration, will affect a greater number of these cases than can any other system. The weakness of our present Act was apparent last year, when two of the greatest disturbances we have had in the country occurred; one on the Canadian Pacific Railway, extending from coast to coast, and the other in the mines of the mountain country of British Columbia. As a matter of fact, strikes are by no means always traceable to the employees, although that phase of the question is not given much attention. There is more than a suspicion that strikes are some times brought about on account of the needs or interests of the stock market for instance, and this has been charged to be the case in reference to some of the disturbances that have occurred in British Columbia. Our present Conciliation Act cannot even get started to investigate such matters. If I understand aright the proposition that has been put forward this afternoon, as far as the transportation companies are concerned they will mechanically come under the operation of this Bill should it ever become law. The minister has said that it involves the policy of compulsory' arbitration. I did not expect that it went

so far as that. I gladly welcome that however, but at the same time that very principle raises the question immediately, of the amount of caution that must be given to the consideration of this law. There must be nothing added to arbitration that will strengthen the fears of those who think that arbitration is only an extension of the method of going forward in the direction of striking a dead level in the matter of men's employment; or, that the law can be used in any way as an utter bar to progress along the lines that organized labour seeks to adhere to. The organization of labour is not now simply based on restlessness. Organization is now gone into on a business basis. Men give up their time and their money to it. They hire others from their own ranks to give their whole time and attention to the advancement of their interests and they expect to reap the benefit of that. They expect through their organization, througli everything they can command to coordinate their interests, that they are going to get what every business man expects to get from his business-a return for the effort put forth; and in no way must the impression go out that the operation of this measure is going to bar the legitimate progress which the labour organization seeks for. As a matter of fact, it need not; but at the same time the opponents of the method now adopted by organized labour may seek to spread the impresion that it aims only to maintain the dead level. If this Bill should finally become law, its scope will be wider than I had dared to expect the Minister of Labour would put before parliament, because I was told two years ago that these matters were beyond the jurisdiction of this parliament; but if it shall extend to street railways, the scope of the measure will be sufficiently wide to enable us to see how this principle does operate; and I, for one, hope it will be found so satisfactory that we may then feel warranted in extending the operation of the principle to other industries.

The only acquaintance we have with the principle at all is obtained from the explanation that has been given by the minister this afternoon. If I understand him aright, the great principle of the Bill is to make strikes impossible on railways. That principle of compulsory arbitration is an experiment in this country, one which has never yet been introduced in any degree in the Dominion of Canada-in fact, I may say on the American continent; but the principle of compulsory arbitration for the settlement of labour disputes is a very common principle in New Zealand and other of the Australian colonies, Mr. PUTTEE.
and a very successful principle at that. I think the minister has acted wisely in not seeking to apply such an important experiment to all the industries of the country. 1 am not certain that even the organized labour men of the country would support the general principle of a national compulsory arbitration. But I think he has acted very wisely in seeking to apply the principle to the operations of railways. A labour dispute on a railway is not like a labour dispute in any other business. We may have, for instance, a strike in a factory, the evils of which are practically confined to the people who live and work in that factory. We may have a strike in a coal mine or in any other kind of mine, the evils of which would be practically confined to the operations of that mine. But in the case of a labour dispute in connection with a railway, we are reminded that the most important factor affected by the outcome of the trouble is the great travelling public. Therefore the minister has acted wisely, when introducing experimental legislation of this kind, in attaching it to that industry which stands not only in greater need, but in absolute need of compulsory arbitration. If the public are to be safeguarded in travelling upon railways, it must be made impossible to have labour disputes on railways. The safety of the public is dependent on a good understanding being maintained between employers and employees on railways, and the only, good reason that can be given for the application of the principle of compulsion in the settlement of disputes between the two parties is that there is a greater party than either which is seriously affected by the operation of a strike. And, Sir, all legislation practically, I may be permitted to say, rests on the principle of compulsion. In almost every instance its purpose is to protect the great public against the peculiar and special interests of private individuals or corporations; and I know no case in which the principle of compulsory arbitration can be applied so successfully as in the operation of railways. I think the minister has acted wisely, too, in permitting this Bill to be printed and circulated through the country for the consideration of the people affected by it. I do not think it would be a proper thing to apply an experiment of this kind without affording the parties affected by it an opportunity of looking into the matter and expressing their opinions upon it. In fact, I think that would be a good rule to follow in connection with all measures of (vast importance-that they should be submitted for the consideration especially of the parties whose interests are likely to be affected by them. That is particularly desirable in a case of this kind, so that the men on the railways and the companies will have an opportunity of looking into this measure fully, and the members of this House will know by next session exactly what the interested parties think of

it, and will then be in a far better position to deal with it. I believe that if this Bill is circulated throughout the country, it will be demonstrated that the employees on railways almost to a man will endorse the'prin-ciple of compulsory arbitration. In my experience, in nine cases out of ten, the labour men all over the country are willing to submit their grievances to arbitration. As a matter of fact, the most important incorporated unions on the American continent have provisions in their constitutions seeking to bring about the settlement of dis putes by arbitration. The whole difficulty about voluntary arbitration in the past has been the objections which corporations have had to the principle. I contend that this is where the government ought to step in, in the interest of the public. It must be admitted by the members of this House that a serious strike on any railway endangers the life of the great public. We must remember this, too, that a strike in a mine may stop the operation of the mine ; but the only people affected toy it are the people directly employed. But a railway must operate. If tha employees refuse to work, or if the employers refuse to concede what they think is their proper claim, the railway must operate all the same ; and there is where the necessity exists for provisions whereby serious troubles on railways may be averted. I think the minister has introduced a principle which will be endorsed by the labour men all over this country, and'I hope he will take every means of circulating this Bill among the interested parties.

The United States are spending on our frontier at least $100,000 per year to keep undesirable immigrants out, and I do not see why we should not enter into an arrangement with them. We do not want undesirable immigrants any more than they do, although we appear to have been anxious rather for numbers than far the best kind. We want immigrants who will make good citizens, but unfortunately we are losing a very large number of our own people who are going to the United States and elsewhere and we ,are getting in their place most undesirable people from the older countries-people not allowed to enter the United States.

We get nb immigrants who would not be allowed to enter the United States. The class of immigrants with which the United States have trouble is not the Austrians, Germans, Russians or Swedes, but those who come from the towns and cities of Italy and who flock to the cities of the United States. You never see those people go on to the agricultural lands either of Canada or the United States. They go into the manufacturing centres.
They go to the manufacturing states of the Union. That class of immigration is what has given trouble in the United States, but we have not been bothered with it. Now, while I say that, I will admit that a very small percentage of Galicians, Austrians, Poles and Germans have had some diseases, but it is a very small percentage. Still, I think that the minister, when drafting this measure, might as well have gone a little further; he might as well have gone as far, almost, as the United States has gone, by providing that not only can an immigrant be stopped at the port of entry, but that he can be deported within a year after arrival if he develops, for instance, insanity and it could be proven that he was insane before he came here. We have had four or five cases of that kind that have been brought to my notice. Fortunately, we were able to get the railway companies to take Mr. SIFTON.
[ them out without compulsion. But we had | to send a man to the sea-board with the j insane, and that cost us some money at least. Then, convicts-we get a small percentage of these. I think that eight or ten catne before the police court in Winnipeg who had served terms in the countries from which they came. I think that five of them came from Denmark. Then, there may be contagious diseases that will not develop at the port of entry-say smallpox that may have been contracted before reaching Canada, but that may not develop until the immigrants have gone far on their way. We know that in 1883 a large number of immigrants, three or four hundred of them, who came from Europe destined to the United States, and reached Winnipeg before the disease developed, cost for quarantine about $14,000. In 1898 a large number came here who must have had small-pox, but the disease was not sufficiently developed to be detected at the port of entry. It is a question whether the municipality that had to undergo the expense ought not to be remunerated for its outlay. Then,.I see no provision in the Bill to compel the railway companies to carry back these immigrants. Most of the immigrants at present coming in come a long distance west, and the government should not be put to the expense of removing these undesirable immigrants. The law of the state of Minnesota and of other states of the Union provides that the railway companies that brought them 'to the state is to carry them out, and that law, if I am not mistaken, was made a federal law within the last two years. I believe that this measure, when put upon the statute-book. will have a desirable effect, but, in my opinion, it does not go far enough to touch the root of the difficulty.

W. F. Maclean, Esq., M.P.,
Ottawa.
(Re Immigration Policy.)
Dear Sir,-I have been instructed by this council to call your attention to .he sum of $445,000, which has been placed in the estimates for this year for the assistance of immigration.
A memorial was sent in to you some time ago by this council, pointing out the reasons why we objected unanimously and most strenuously to the expenditure of public money for -his purpose. The members of this council wish me to express their regret that so far their communication has received no consideration in this matter.
Thie reports show that there has been expended for the assistance of immigration during the last ten years $2,400,173. Must not the effect of this policy be to intensify the competition on to which labour is at present subject?

Is there any other class in the community which is treated in this way ?
The excuse has been made that assistance is given only to those who intend to settle on the land ; but how can that make the slightest difference? The intention of the government will no more determine the ultimate destination of the settlers, than it will affect the flow of the tides. To say that labour in the rural districts will not compete with the wage earner is just as foolish as to say that water will not find its level. All the facts of the case are against such a contention During the last hundred years the movement on this continent from the rural district to the cities has been sc marked that whereas the civic population a century ago was only three per cent of the whole, at the present time it is upwards of thirty per cent.
While tho general population on this continent has doubled every twenty-five years, the civic population has doubled every ten years. How, therefore, can any government say that the immigration will not drift into the cities, as it has been doing all along ? Suppose the assistance was confined to those who will take up agricultural land would that be the slightest justification for this policy ? When we ask the question, who is it bears the burden of taxation ? Is it the man who works alii day, or is it some other man who collects his thousands of dollars yearly from ground rents or who draws his immense dividends from some coal ' mimes ? There can be no question as to the correct answer. Industry and Industry alone must bear the burden all the time. Then when we ask the further question, who reaps the benefit from this policy, what must be the answer ? Increased population does not increase the price of goods, nor does it increase the rate of wages ; but it does increase the price of land. Already the price of land in Winnipeg, which had almost no value thirty years ago, is now a thousand dollars per foot frontage on the best sites. In this city the best lots have increased fifty-fold in seventy years. Are we not fully warranted in stating that the immigration policy taxes industry to enable the land owner to subject the toilers to still greater exactions ?	_
Has the government ever used one dollar of taxes to enable the workingmen to buy their goods cheaper, or to reduce the exactions of the land owners? Never, but while it places a tariff to shield the employers from foreign competition and whilst it brings increased rents to the land owners, to the working classes there is not merely unrestricted competition, but that competition intensified by assisted immigration.
The effect of this policy must he to keep wages down to the lowest figures.
We regret that we are r.hU3 compelled to draw your attention to this disregard of our request, so reasonable and so just.
I have the honour to be, sir,
Your obedient servant,

The inconsistency of the statement made is shown by the reference to the values of land In the city of Winnipeg thirty years ago. There happened to be no city of Winnipeg thirty years ago. I believe it was incorporated in 1874. Before that time, it was only an Indian settlement, and its lands had no value at all. This letter involves a contention that I have often discussed with the labour unions. They wish us to believe that in bringing immigrants and settling them on the land, developing the prairie country and raising forty, fifty or sixty million of bushels of wheat a year, we do not increase the price of labour. I think that is one of the most ridiculous things that could be stated before this House. For instance, take the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1890 and 1891, how much of their rolling stock was standing idle in their round-houses? In some seasons practically 50 per cent of that rolling stock is idle, and. of course, the crews of the engines are thrown out of work. In seasons when there is a large crop, not only are none of these men Idle, but a large number of extra men are employed. We need only look at the facts to see at once the fallacy of this argument.

KENNEDY,",,,"I am glad to see this Bill introduced, very glad to support its provisions, and only sorry that it does not go a great deal further. When we say that we are dealing with the question of increasing our population, we are not dealing with the whole question, for there is not merely the question of increase, hut the question of improvement before us. When we deal with the immigration question without considering it from the standpoint of the possibility and necessity of efforts being made to improve the population as we increase it, we are not dealing with the subject as its importance requires. It seems to me strange that it should be required, at 'this date, to provide checks on the entrance of diseased immigrants to our country. If such checks have not existed in the 'past, they certainly cau-not be provided too soon, nor can they he made too complete.
But from my standpoint the diseases existing amongst Immigrants are hut a trifling consideration in comparison with the general character of the immigrants. I cannot understand the frame of mind which looks carelessly upon the introduction into the very life of our country of a population without regard to whether such population will raise or lower the general standard of our people. Let the people who come in be the healthiest in the world, if their disposition,

and ambition, and inclination are not such as will help us to realize our ideals, then then presence is objectionable and a detriment to us. I am not claiming that we are the best people in the world ; that our civilization is the highest form of civilization ; but I do claim that our present civilization suits us, and it is that which we have set ourselves to improve. Our social system, our political system, our religious system are those which we have inherited and under which we are trying to improve ourselves. Then if it is worth while to organize all these systems for the purpose of improving ourselves in this country, it is surely worth while to take means that our efforts shall not be to a certain extent rendered useless by the introduction of an element into our population which will have a contrary effect. It is not necessary to say that such people are not as good as we are. Possibly a Chinaman is a better man than an Englishman, let the Englishman answer for that himself; a Japanese may be a better man or a Russian may be a better man than the Englishman ; I say nothing about that, he may be a much better man, but he is not one of us, and inasmuch as he is not one of us he is not helping us to develop along those lines that Providence has chosen for us, or that we have chosen for ourselves. His presence is a hindrance and not a help.
This country is of immense extent, it is of equally immense possibilities. The population of Canada at the present time occupies but a very small part of our total area, and turns to account but a very small part of our total resources. We have five millions of people in a country capable of supporting easily fifty millions. It does not need any demonstration on my part to show that if the increase of population which will necessarily take place in the development of those resources, is of a character and constitution essentially different from our own, not only will they build up a different civilization whenever they establish themselves, but they will infallibly control our civilization in this part of the country. One to ten, the odds are too many. The western prairies are the seat and cradle of the future population of this Dominion. They are the seat of power and control, and as' that population is. so will this Dominion be. If you will fill those prairies1 with people of different ideas, different aspirations and different views from our own, you are simply placing yourselves under a yoke, you are swerving your country from that ' destiny which your fathers intended it, and which you fondly hoped you were achieving. It is I say, under the present circumstances of this Dominion, a matter of the highest necessity that the population we introduce into this country should be like minded with ourselves, so far as that is possible, if we are to achieve greatness as we understand greatness, if we are to achieve civilization Mr. OLIVER.
as we understand civilization, if we are to achieve liberty in government as we understand liberty in government.
Some years ago we believed, or some of us believed, that those vast areas of fertile country in the west must for ever remain unpeopled, or become inhabited with such people as we could gather from any corner of the world. But nobody thinks that today. At present people are thronging into those territories by thousands, people equal to ourselves in intelligence, in energy, in ambition, in civilization, like-minded with ourselves in almost every particular. There is no danger that these prairies will not be occupied by people such as we will be proud to work with in building up our civilization. There is, however, one danger, and only one, and that is that they may be occupied by other and inferior people who will keep out those whom we desire to help us in establishing and improving our institutions. I say that every undesirable settler who enters the North-west, who is, we will say, inferior to ourselves in his knowledge of government, in his ideas of liberty, is a detriment to this country, inasmuch as to a certain extent he displaces another man whose ideas are similar to our own.
I believe in immigration, and in a vigorous immigration policy. But I also believe that when we are spending money to bring immigrants into our country the first consideration should be the intellectual as well as the physical quality of those immigrants.
I would like to say that our immigration policy as directed to the United States has been a pronounced success, and I am glad to believe that it will continue to be so. I am sorry to say that as directed to the British islands, to the mother country, or to the mother countries, if you like, it has not been a pronounced success. I think I am safe in saying that up to date it has been a dismal failure. I have heard it said that we need not look to the British islands for immigrants to people our country ; that the supply was practically exhausted. If that is the case, it is a melancholy condition. It is a marvellous thing if those two islands, which have carried liberty and civilization, and conquest, if you like, around the world, are as to population in a state of decadence, and that we cannot look for any further immigration from that quarter. ' But, if we look at the records, we find that people are still flowing out of those apparently, except Canada. I am given to understand that a new system is being adopted in regard to immigration from the British isles. I am not familiar with the details of that system, but I will say that there is no possibility of adopting any system which could be less effective than that which has prevailed during the past years.
I am satisfied that any system that is adopted will be an improvement. Now, I would like to say that in my estimation, if we. as

Canadians, wish to get the fullest benefit from the settlement of the North-west Territories, it is necessary that that settlement should be, as much as possible of people not only much like ourselves, but altogether like ourselves, not only in ideas of civilization, but also in political traditions; in other words, that we should draw upon the British islands as much as possible for our immigration for that country and that every effort should be made to attract immigration from the British isles.
Let me say further that it appears to me to have been a mistake in the past to have spent so much money as we have in paying bonuses to steamship companies for the conveyance of immigrants and for this reason : We made the steamship companies, by that means our immigration agencies, and It did not make any difference to the steamship companies what the character of the immigrant was, who he was, or where he was from, so long as they got the bonus. It seems to me, from my point of view, that this is a most undesirable system and a' most undesirable expenditure, and I would ask that it be not continued. Understand me, I do not object to large expenditures for immigration, but I want these expenditures to be made with a view of securing the better people and not the worse. To depend on the steamship company is to put a premium upon the worse rather than upon the better.
I would like to say still further and to urge upon the House at large, upon hon. members who come from all parts of this Dominion, that the immigrant who is of the most benefit to this country in every way is the man of our own -blood, namely, the native-born Canadian, who, finding it necessary to shift his ground, must go either to the United States or to the Canadian Northwest.

I say that in my estimation it is a mistake, and the worst kind of mistake to consider that it is not a question of interest to this country or to this parliament whether our people go to the North-west Territories or not. I have heard it said here, and in the country that we want our people to stay at home. Of course we want our people to stay at home, but unless we nail them down they will not stay at home if the conditions are not suitable. It is because of the disposition and the determination to better themselves that they are so valuable as settlers wherever they may go, and they make such a success. I cannot look upon the matter quietly when I see from the census returns that we have 1,000,000 native-born Canadians in the United States, while we have in Manitoba and the North-west Territories considerably less than half a million of people of all nationalities. There
must necessarily be in the United States four native-born Canadians for every one that is in the North-west Territories. I put it to this House and to the government that this country has made a more substantial loss in all' that constitutes value by the transference of the energy and wealth of our people to the United States rather than to the North-west Territories than it has from any other cause. There is no other cause that has tended so much to the comparatively slow progress of this Dominion as the fact that our life blood has been drained across the line. While we have been trying to develop our own country with other people, the United States has been developed, to a large extent, by our people. It is a matter of the utmost interest to every man in every province of this Dominion that the people of Canada should be retained in Canada, and if they cannot be retained in one part they should lie retained in another, if possible. That there should be no lack of effort put forth to secure the settlement of our own surplus population where we have surplus land to dispose of amply sufficient for all of them.

I do not know whether any provision has been made by the Minister of the Interior (Hon. Mr. Si-fton) in this Bill, or whether provision is contained in the statute already in existence, to compel railway and steamship companies to bear all the expense attendant upon the return) of undesirable immigrants brought by them to the country. My attention has been drawn to chapter 65 of the Revised Statutes of 1886, which deals with immigration and immigrants. Subsection 2 of section 17 provides for a bond to be entered into by the steamship companies for the return of lunatics, or for the indemnifying of a province or municipality in case a lunatic is permitted to remain in the country. Section 18 makes provision as follows :
The proper immigration agent may, with the consent of the Minister of Agriculture, make arrangements with the master, owner or charterer of the vessel carrying the lunatic, idiotic, deaf and dumb, blind or infirm person with respect to whom a bond has been given, or money paid in lieh thereof, or with the master, owner or charterer of any other vessel, for the re-conveyance of such person to the port from which he was carried to Canada.
Section 23 deals with pauper immigration :
The Governor General may, by proclamation, whenever he deems it necessary, prohibit the landing of pauper or destitute immigrants in all ports or any port in Canada, until such sums of money as are found necessary are provided and paid into the hands of one of the Canadian immigration agents, that the master of the vessel carrying such immigrants, for their temporary support and transport to their place of destination.
And so on. 1 believe a proclamation was issued a year or two ago against the ad-

mission into Canada of pauper immigrants. It would seem to me, from what I have seen in the papers since, that the proclamation is practically a dead letter, and that Canada is still being made a dumping ground for a very undesirable class of immigrants.
I noticed in the Montreal ' Herald,' just about a year ago, an article referring to the arrival of a very large number of des-titue Italians at Montreal. The Montreal ' Herald ' is not a paper that would knowingly or wilfully make a statement derogatory to the government. The ' Herald,' of the Cth of April, 1901, had an article entitled : ' Influx of Italians to Montreal.'
' About 2,000 now here.' ' Many of them penniless and unable to find work.' It seems to me that if the provisions of the proclamation issued by the government had been enforced, it would have been impossible for these people to have been permitted to have come into Montreal, and to be a tax upon the good people of that city and other parts of the Dominion. I am not opposed, Mr. Chairman, to any ablebodied immigrant coming to Canada. I rather think that we ought to endeavour to promote a vigorous immigration policy, but of course limiting the immigrants to the right class-of good character and not destitute. So far, the policy inaugurated by hon. gentlemen opposite has not been as successful as we would like to see it in that respect. It is a lamentable fact, a fact which has been substantiated in this House, that a large number of diseased immigrants have been brought into Canada, are now in Canada, and are being maintained at the expense of the Canadian people. The hon. member for Lennox (Mr. Wilson), in the recent debate on immigration, read copious extracts from a statement sent to him by one of the officials of the United States government, stationed in Canada for the purpose of examining immigrants who arrive here destined for the United States, and of determining whether they shall be permitted to enter that country or not. It seems to me a most deplorable condition of things that we should have a staff of thirty-five or forty United States officials stationed in Canada, sorting out and examining the immigrants who land at Canadian ports en route to the United States, and determining who shall be given certificates to enable them to enter the United States, and who shall not. That is a condition of things that should be put a stop to. It can be stopped in two ways; either by having a more careful examination of emigrants before they leave the ports in Europe whence they sail, or, having our own agents take charge of them when they land here, and preventing those who are undesirable in any way from staying in this country. The clauses of the Immigration Act which I read, seem to me to give the government power to prohibit the introduction of diseased pauper immigrants into Canada. But

KENNEDY,",,,"in the Bill which the hon. minister (Mr. Sifton) has introduced, I do not find that any provision has been made to compel the railway companies and the steamship companies to assume the expense which the people of Canada are put to in order to deport these undesirable immigrants to the country whence they came. The hon. member for East York (Mr. Maclean) read from a circular which has been sent to every member of the House-a protest from the Toronto Trades and Labour Council against indiscriminate immigration. That is not the first document of the bind which has been submitted to members of parliament during the present session. There was a document issued at the beginning of the session, away back in the middle of February, and which I believe was sent to every member of this House. That document declares very strongly against indiscriminate immigration. It says :
The council-Toronto Trades and Labour Council-does not raise the slightest objection, or refuse the fullest welcome to suitable immigrants who come of their own accord, but they do most emphatically object to the taxation of labour in order to flood the labour market against, the wage earner, and to favour the protected capitalists. While the tariff even favours the employer 50 per cent, the immigration policy cuts down the wage of labour, we know not how much per cent.
If that statement is true with regard to healthy Immigrants, it has much more force In the case of undesirable immigrants; diseased immigrants wbo are permitted to come to Canada-immigrants who are not able to earn tbeir own living and wbo become a tax on the people of this country. The Montreal ' Star,' on the 22nd of March, had a number of sketches of the types of immigrants who have been landing in Canada during the past two or three months. It bad also what purports to be an interview with this very same Mr. Watchorn, the special United States immigration inspector in Canada, and the statement that this gentleman makes shows that a not very desirable class of immigrants is coming into Canada. This article is beaded :
' Menace to the health of Montreal.' ' How the city is being made a dumping ground for immigrants rejected by the United States inspector.' ' Disease and dirt being scattered broadcast amongst them.' ' How the American inspectors carry on theiEB work.' The introductory paragraphs of this article are as follows :
Ninety-eight per cent of the European immigrants who are prohibited from entering the United States by the American officials in Montreal and at other points of entry along the border, are suffering from Infectious diseases which are the direct result of filth and lack of sanitary methods. Such is the startling statement made by Mr. Robert Watchorn, the special immigration inspector, who has charge of all the immigrant inspectors from Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, to Montreal, Including Port Huron'

Detroit, Niagara Falls, Black Rock, Buffalo and Vanceboro, Maine.
How long has the work being going on ?
Officially, since the first of last September.
And what has been the result since the first of September ?
That about 500 persons have been, rejected as unfit, either physically, mentally, morally or financially, to enter the United States.
And these were all rejected right here in Montreal ?
Yes, in Montreal.
To say nothing of the other points of entry where no doubt similar rejections were made ?
Exactly.
What would be the percentage of refusals at Detroit, the Soo, Port Huron, Niagara Falls, Black Rock, St. John and Vanceboro ?
I should say that all these points combined would have about as many as Montreal.
That would be one thousand, and these figures would corroborate the statement made by Mr. Watchorn in a letter to the hon. member for Lennox (Mr. Wilson) in which he stated that since the inspection commenced in September last, 1,000 diseased immigrants, disqualified immigrants, whose destination was the United States, were prohibited from entering that country, and many of them unhappily and unfortunately have been permitted to remain in Canada. So far as I understand this Bill, the minister has not made any provision for the deportation of these people, many of whom are still in the country; nor is there any provision to compel the railway and steamship companies to hear all the expense in connection with their deportation.
My hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) referred to the decreasing number of immigrants of British origin, who are coming into Canada. From the reports which I have seen in the papers during the last three or four weeks, I am led to believe there will be a larger number of British immigrants coming into Canada during the present season, than for many years past, and X am glad to see that statement made. The hon. member for Alberta said that it was alleged that the stream of immigration from the British Isles has fallen off. That is not the case. If the official statistics of the United States can be relied upon, during the past ten years over three-quarters of a million of immigrants of British birth left the old country and have found a home in the United States. During the past thirty years more than three millions of our kith and kin have left the United Kingdom and have gone to the United States. Greater efforts it seems to me, should he made, and I hope they will be more successful, to induce a larger number of Irish, English and Scotch to make their hotnes in Canada, and to try to turn the tide of immigration from the United States towards Canada. I believe that in proportion to the total number of immigrants coming into this country, we are receiving too large a percentage of foreign-born. In 1891, 118
of our total immigration we received 70 per cent of British origin and about 30 per cent of foreign origin, whereas in the last five years the tables have been turned, the proportion being about 30 per cent British and 70 per cent foreign. That, in my humble judgment, is not a satisfactory state of affairs, and proper steps should be taken to induce a larger percentage of people to come from the old land and settle here and help to build up this country. To show that this undesirable class of immigrants is still trying to find its way through Canada to the United States, and is still being turned back at the frontier, I will read a clipping which I have taken from the Toronto ' Evening Star ' of March 22nd. The Toronto ' Evening Star ' is a very able and enterprising journal, and is not by any means hostile to the government of the day. That journal has a despatch from its Montreal correspondent, dated March 22nd, headed : ' Turned back from border-United States will not admit a woman and her children whose eyes are sore; ' showing how closely United States immigration agents are watching immigrants, as people who have sore eyes are intercepted at the border and sent back. This is the despatch :
Montreal; March 22.-Mr. Joseph Francis, immigration inspector .of the United States government at Niagara, formerly chairman of the United States Immigration Board in this city, was here this week with a family of rejected immigrants, who attempted to get through to Philadelphia by way of Niagara Falls.
The family in question:-a woman and four children:-arrived in St. John, N.B., suffering from trachoma, a peculiar and highly infectious form of eye disease, which leads to blindness. Their destination was Philadelphia, hut being unable to pass' the medical inspector there, she came up to Montreal, and being refused here, she went on to Toronto, representing that she was going to join a cousin there, the cousin in that case representing the relationship of a compatriot, and not of blood. On the second day after her arrival she secured a ticket for Philadelphia and went on by way of Niagara Falls. There she came under the inspection of Mr. Francis, who passed her on to a medical practitioner, who pronounced her to he in an advanced stage of trachoma, and likely to be blind within- a year. Ons of her eyes is permanently closed, and when moving she stoops and leans forward in the manner common to the partially blind. The children have all been smitten, with the disease, tut if properly attended to they may be cured.
This woman, according to this statemeut, came to New Brunswick as an immigrant, intending to go to the United States. The official in New Brunswick who examined her refused to give her the necessary certificate to enable her to pass into that country. Notwithstanding that, she came on to Montreal and from Montreal to Toronto, and at Toronto purchased a ticket in the hope of being able to evade the authorities and pass into the United States by way of Niagara Falls. The vigilance of the officers at Niagara Falls prevented her accomplishing



her purpose, and she was turned hack; and that woman, unless some provision is made by either the United Sates authorities or the Canadian authorities for paying her passage back and the passage of her family, not having herself the means of returning to her native country, will be obliged to remain in Canada, and, unfortunately for herself and her children, will become a burden on the people of this country. This condition of things, in my opinion, calls for the most drastic remedy. The most perfect provision should be made to .stop for all time diseased and pauper immigrants coming into this country. I am not sure whether the Bill of the hon. minister makes the necessary provision, because I see nothing in the Bill which enables the government to collect from the steamship companies the cost of deporting those people and the moneys it will expend in providing inspectors to do this work. In that respect we might take a leaf out of the book of the United States government. I believe that they collect a tax from the steamship companies, which has been found amply sufficient to cover the cost of a thorough inspection of all immigrants who go into that country without the people of the United States having to bear a single dollar of the expense .of that service. The time has come when a similar provision should be adopted here ; and if this Bill is wanting in any of its provisions, the minister should amend it so as to make it as clear and explicit as it can be made. The^ trades and labour organizations of the Dominion, as the hon. member for Hast York (Mi-. Maclean) has pointed out, are objecting strenuously to the expenditures made by this government on account of immigration. In one paragraph of then-circular, they say :
For many years enormous sums, at times exceeding $400,000 in a single year, have been expended for the purpose of aiding the importation of cheap labour into this country.
Further they say :
Agents have been sent ti>
the poorest countries in the world to flood our labour market with a host of men, women and children, anxious to secure work and glad to accept work at almost any price. And these emigrants are induced to come here even at times when thousands of labourers are tramping the streets in idleness, vainly looking for employment. I
I would like to ask the Minister of the Interior to say whether he himself examines the literature which is distributed-by immigration agents throughout the United Kingdom and Europe before it is issued by the department, or whether he keeps any file or record of that literature ; because it is stated from time to time by the representatives of the trades organizations that the most glaring misstatements are made by immigration agents appointed by the government, and that as a result of the distri-Mr. CLARKE.
button of these misstatements many people are induced to come to Canada, who, when they come, find that things are not as rosy as they were painted, and that they are unable to get on as well as they expected, or to find employment as readily as they were told they could. If that is the case, when these people come they get dissatisfied, and are liable to make statements which do damage to the country. I would like to ask the minister if he himself assumes the responsibility for the literature distributed by the immigration agents throughout the old country, because if the allegations made by the trade organizations are correct, many of these statements are entirely unwarranted and misleading.

KENNEDY,",,,"The House spent a whole day a short time ago in discussing the question of immigration, and most of the remarks which have been made by hon. gentlemen who have spoken this afternoon will be found answered or dealt with in the discussion which took place on that occasion. That may be said, almost without qualification, of the remarks which have been made by my hon. friend who has just taken his seat. The points he brought up were practically all answered in the discussion which took place here on a former occasion, and I would only be unnecessarily detaining the House by going over the same ground again. He will find that I dealt fully with the allegations regarding the wholesale dumping of diseased immigrants at our ocean ports, and showed conclusively that these allegations were wholly unfounded. There has been nothing of the kind to such an extent as even to justify any reference to it in this House. What has occurred has been of a most trifling character, such as is bound to occur under any administration.
Just a word with regard to the position of affairs at the ocean ports. The hon. member for Uennox urges that we should make some arrangement with the United States. There is no necessity for any arrangement. so far as the examination of immigrants is concerned. We are quite competent to attend to that without any arrangement. We have consented to the American officers making examinations at our ports of immigrants in transit to the United States, but as these are practically all examined by our officers, the examination is to all intents and purposes complete.

39272,ca.proc.d.1902-04-29.5.10,1902-04-29,intervention,,,,"D. AV. KENNEDY,",,,"I cannot say anything in regard to a spe-

cial case reported in a newspaper. In the first place, I do not know that the facts are as stated, and in the second place, the case was never 'brought to my attention. But at present, at Quebec, St. John and Halifax, we have a very complete and thorough system of examinations, and this Bill is brought in for the purpose of remedying a defect in the law. I am advised by the law officers of the government that we have not the power to prevent people of the particular class referred to in this Bill from landing, or to compel them to leave Canada once they have landed. If the hon. member for Toronto would refer to my remarks in the debate on immigration, he will find that I showed by the figures I gave, that there were no people of this class now in Canada, with the exception of four or five who were at St. John, waiting an opportunity to get away, and who in all probability have gone. The government desires simply to be in a position to enforce that which every one admits we ought to enforce. The only point made against the Bill is that suggested by the hon. member for Selkirk (Mr. McCreary). He says that we should take power to deport immigrants from inland portions of the country. We have not yet seen the necessity of doing this, because cases of no importance or difficulty have yet arisen. There can be no special objection to our taking such power, but It has not been thought necessary because no difficulty has arisen.
As regards the literature circulated in the United States and other foreign countries, it is wholly impossible for me to examine all the immigration literature prepared for the department. The superintendent, Mr. Pedley, is directly responsible for the preparation of all literature issued from Canada and sent to the United States. The literature circulated in Great Britain and on the continent has heretofore been almost entirely prepared by or through our office in London, but that system is now changed, and it is our intention that it shall be prepared here, and the superintendent, of immigration will examine all the literature himself and be directly responsible to me. I do not believe that there is any substantial ground for the statement that any of our immigration literature has the effect of leading people to suppose that they can get employment readily in Canada. I am aware that some gentlemen connected with the trades and labour councils of different places are in the habit of making broad statements of that kind. But I have not been able to get any evidence from these gentlemen to indicate that they have any ground for making such state* ment. Under any system whatever of immigration, encouraged and stimulated by advertising and employment of agents, there will always be numbers of people admitted who will not be perhaps the most desirable class, and a certain number will perhaps not 1184
belong to the class the agent thought they did belong to. And a certain number will come in who, perhaps, will not follow the occupation which it was anticipated they would. No department that has ever existed could carry out a system of encouraging immigration without having these results follow to some extent. As to the statement that there is any encouragement, directly or avowedly given to persons to come in for the purpose of finding employment, that is entirely incorrect. I have discussed that question at different times in the House. Cases have been cited of persons who have alleged that they were encouraged to come in under these circumstances. I have always replied that the instructions to the officers of the department were most explicit, definite and positive, and that in every possible way we have tried to prevent any one being encouraged to come to Canada, except those who were desirous of following agricultural pursuits. These things cannot be carried out with absolute perfection, but that is the purpose of the department. Clear instructions are given to that effect, and everything done that is possible to carry out . the policy I have indicated. Now, as to the suggestion made by my hon. friend from Toronto, that we should levy a poll-tax upon steamship companies to pay expenses in connection with this work, I may say that I consider that suggestion wholly impracticable at the present time. If any attempt were made in that direction, we should put the steamship companies who are carrying a portion of the immigrants to Canada out of the business, and, instead of getting 11,000 or 12,000 British immigrants, as we get at the present time, we should get few or none. We have to adapt ourselves to the circumstances as they exist. The circumstances of the United States are wholly different from our own. In the United States they do not wish immigration, they would prefer it if nobody came from outside to settle in that country. Their population is felt to be large enough. The natural increase of their 75,000,000 of people will soon render the position in the United States difficult for the statesmen of that country to handle it. Anything that they can do to discourage immigration they do-in fact, they do some things that they themselves would hardly approve of on principle to discourage the bringing the people from outside. We are in a wholly different position and are seeking immigration. Of course, we do not wish those of an undesirable class ; but, in seeking to make distinctions, we must not adopt a policy that would close up entirely the source of supply. Speaking of the question of the nationality of our immigrants, I do not admit that my hon. friend from Alberta (Mr. Oliver) is correct when he says that the policy, so far as the United Kingdom is concerned, could not

have been a greater failure than it has been. I explained in Committee of Supply, when the estimates were under discussion, my reasons for believing that the practice of the department in Great Britain had not been, perhaps, as successful as it might have been, and pointed out that improvements might be made by changing some of the methods that have been followed. I also explained the changes which had been made with a view to improvement. But because I took steps to effect improvement, I do not admit that that shows that the work had been an absolute failure. Far from it. For instance, during the last calendar year, when something like 49,000 to 50,000 immigrants were received in Canada, about
18.000	came from the United States, practically all British-born, and between 11,000 and 12.000 from the British Islands. So, while the statement of the hon. member for Toronto Is technically correct, that nearly 70 per cent of the total immigration was foreign-born, yet, it must be remembered that, for the purpose of making that calculation intelligible, it must be considered that the people from the United States are foreign-born, whereas, they are not so. Not only are they of Anglo-Saxon blood

But the fact is that the United States officials decide who are to go into the United States, and our officials decide who are to come into Canada. The United States officials are permitted to decide who are going into the United States. If there was a movement of immigration from the United States ports into Canada there would be no objection whatever on the part of the United States government to our placing officials at ports in their territories for the purpose of examining immigrants coming into Canada-there would be no objection whatever on the part of any government on ordinarily friendly terms with us to such a course being taken. But the hon. gentleman, in his first remarks, as I understood him, said that these United

States officials decided who should come into Canada. That is a point which I wish to make clear. Whether the hon. gentleman intended to make it or not, I want to make it clear that such is not the fact, that our own officials decide, after inspection, upon the immigrants that are admitted, and thev alone are responsible if any persons are permitted to get past the line and come into Canada and remain, who ought not to be allowed to come in and remain here. He stated the law was objectionable, that the law was defective, because it did not give us sufficient power. But the hon. gentleman has not yet put himself clearly upon record as to what he means by attacking the position of the government, in quoting this article from the Montreal ' Herald.' What I say is that parliament has never clothed the government with power to say that any persons should not come into this country who are in possession of all their faculities, who are not diseased, who are not criminal, and who do not come within the class of paupers, who do not come within any of the classes specified in this Act. They have provided that we might exclude paupers, criminals, persons of unsound mind; and now we ask to be permitted to exclude other persons who have any dangerous or infectious disease. But parliament has never clothed the government with the power of saying to a man at our boundary line, who is sound in wind and limb, perfect physically and morally-parliament has never authorized the government to prevent such persons from crossing the boundary line.

The hon. gentleman is trying to create a prejudice against the government because these Italians came in, because it was stated in the press that they were persons who were unable to take care of themselves, and would be a charge upon the community, or something to that effect.

United States. It is clear that the United States officers reject very great numbers that we accept. I contend that the immigrant who is not good enough for the United States is not good enough for Canada ; I do not care how he comes here. I contend that the evidence is plain, that we have not a proper supervision over immigrants. The very fact that the 'Americans have 44 officials in Canada inspecting immigrants whose destination is the United States, is of itself sufficient to show that the Canadian inspection is very lax. The minister (Hon. Mr. Sifton) stated in reply to my colleague (Mr. Clarke) : That if he charged $1 a head poll tax the steamship companies would at once take their immigrants to the United States. That is a very nice admission coming from the Minister of Immigration. It shows that it is not the money that Canada spends, that brings these immigrants to Canada, but that it is the steamship companies who are bringing them here for the sake of the passage money. If one dollar poll tax is going to exclude immigrants, I wonder what is the use of our expending large sums of money on immigration. Let us rather, at once pay subsidies to the steamship companies to bring in whom they like. If we assume that these 2,000 destitute Italians came in here without the bounty, they are at all events included in the number of immigrants that the minister takes credit for having brought here on account of the money expended. The impression left on my mind by this debate is, that the regulations for the inspection of immigrants coming into Canada are decidedly loose, and that people are being admitted here who are excluded from the United States ; people who tend to deteriorate the quality of our population. There was recently a very strong expression of opinion in this House against permitting scrub horses to be imported into the west to deteriorate the stock in that country. Shall we be less particular as to the kind of men we bring into this country to mix with our population, than we are as to the kind of animals we allow to be imported ?

competing witn us, and if we excited the hostility of the steamship companies, the agents of these companies would endeavour to neutralize the efforts of our own officers, and the result might be that we would get no immigrants.

The hon. gentleman (Mr. Osier) says that an immigrant who is not fit to go to the United States is not fit to come into Canada, and he appeared to be under the impression that he was expressing a very lofty sentiment. Well, I express the sentiment, that the government of Canada is at least just as competent through its officers to decide who is to come into Canada, as the officers of the United States government are competent to decide for them. I am not in favour of leaving it to the officers of the United States government to decide who is to come into Canada. If that be the policy which the hon. gentleman (Mr. Osier) advocates, I dissent from it. and I cannot hold out any hope that I am likely to adopt his view. The actual fact is that the whole thing is a tempest in a tea pot. There is actually nothing in it : it amounts to nothing. If the hon. gentleman will read the remarks I made, he wifi see that practically the whole thing reduced itself to something like 33 or 34 people out of almost a year's work, and that there was the merest trifle of difference between the work of the American officers and our officers. There were some 23 or 24 people who were permitted to go into the North-west simply because the United States officers rejected them upon grounds which one of our inspectors did not consider sufficient, namely, because there was some trifling disease amongst the children. Outside of that, to all intents and purposes the result of the examination has been the same.

It is a matter of indifference to the people of this country whether he declines to' be held responsible or not-the people of this country will hold him responsible. It is not a matter that is optional with him; it is a matter that is optional with them. He says he declines to be judged by a newspaper statement. This is not a newspaper statement, but the statement of an official of the American government, which we believe to be reliable. But the hon. Minister of the Interior, who is charged with the responsibility of preventing undesirable people coming and settling Hon. Mr. SIFTON.
in the country, allows them to come in, and then says, I decline to be held responsible for it. I think the people of the country will form their own opinion with regard to that, regardless of the hon. gentleman's wishes in the matter. The hon. gentleman says we are quite as capable of judging from the evidence as the Americans. We are, but if we never act upon that judgment, what good is it ? And that is the position of the hon. gentleman; he has never acted on that judgment. He has sent his agents scouring around the world to get immigrants, whether they are suitable or unsuitable. Last year he spent $444,000 on immigration, and got 49,000 immigrants. Can he tell us how many of these immigrants were such as the people of the United States considered it necessary to send from their country ? Not by any means. We are quite satisfied that there are some thousands of them, because we have had information that the people of Montreal last year had to support these people for months in order to keep them from starvation. Then, other immigrants have come in who have been diseased. The minister says he had not the power to keep them out. He is taking the power now. He says the number is infinitesimal. Then, why does he require an Act to get the power ? I have always thought that although we require immigrants, the number we bring in is not a matter of so much importance as to know that those that do come are suitable to the country. That, I think, is the first requirement. It is not a fact, so far as the information disclosed enables us to judge, that the number brought in by the present government are all suitable. A large number are not suitable, because of diseases and weaknesses incident to human nature. I think that in future the great source from which we will draw our immigrants will be the overflow of population from the United States. They will be very suitable settlers for this country, and whether we send agents or not, they will come in in thousands to buy lands. This migration started many years ago under the late government, and it has been going on with increasing force ever since, and will continue whether we spend large sums to promote it or not. We have often heard of what the present government have done for the country, how many immigrants they have brought in. They have not by any means brought in as many proportionate to the expenditure as their predecessors did. If they had done so last year, instead of bringing in 49,000 they would have brought over 61,000; or if they had only spent proportionately as much money for the number they brought in as their predecessors spent, instead of spending $444,000, they would only have spent $360,000. So that there is nothing to boast of in their immigration policy, but there is much to be condemned. I believe the steam' ship companies are paid their bonuses every

time, regardless of the class of people they bring to the country. We cannot awake too soon to the situation, when we see the number of people our American friends are sending back. Instead of the number being infinitesimal, as the minister says, I am inclined to think the people of the country will regard it as a very much more serious matter; and they will hold him responsible for doing less than his duty when he has not taken steps sooner to keep that undesirable class out of the country.

I think the hon. gentleman ought to be thankful to the opposition for drawing his attention to what they believe to be weak points in our immigration policy. I want to draw the attention of the minister and the committee to a specific statement regarding our statistics of immigration. Mr. Watohorn, the United States officer, writes as follows to the hon. member for Lennox :
You will observe on page 34 of the Commis-sit-r er General's report that the increase of immigration' from Canada to the United States from 1896 to 1900 has been very heavy and is in fact very much in excess of what these figures indicate. I think your official reports will bear out the statement that for this year ending June 30th,	1901, approximately 50,000
alien immigrants arrived at Canadian seaports,
24.000	of them destined for the United States, which leaves the inference to be drawn that
26.000	remained in Canada, but these figures are totally misleading.
This is a statement made by Mr. Robert Watchorn. the special immigration inspector for the United States. He declares that these figures are totally misleading and gives as his reasons :
Because of the 26.000 credited to Canada for the time specified, no less than 300 per month were given certificates of admission' to the United States in Montreal alone, within less than 30 days of their arrival at the Canadian port.
Yet we are told that we are getting these immigrants in by the ten thousand.

They only stay long enough in Canada to get certificates from the American officials which will enable them to go to the United States. Is not that statement
worth looking into in order to ascertain whether it is well founded or not? And the hon. minister ought to consider himself indebted to the opposition for .drawing his attention to it. The statements I have quoted are very frequently to be found in the newspapers. I am not responsible for them, but would be derelict in my duty if I did not draw the attention of the minister to such statements when they are brought under my notice.

On section 1,
The MINISTER OF TH*E INTERIOR (Hon. Clifford Sifton). I explained when this Bill was introduced that its purpose was to make the sales and homestead entries subject to the right of the territorial government to open a road across the lands. At the present time the territorial government is called upon to open a considerable number of new roads, and in some places, owing to the fact that the road allowances cut across ravines it is very expensive to build a road. In many cases they find it necessary to open new roads in lieu of the road allowances. The purpose of the Bill is to make entries and sales subject to the right of the territorial government to have a right of way free of charge over those lands. The territorial government find it a considerable burden to have to settle for right of way for every road that they desire to open up. It is no hardship at ail to require persons who buy or enter for homesteads to take them subject to this right. The Bill provides that the amount so taken shall not be more than five per cent of the total. Hon. members will find that the Bill is so drawn that in the eighth line of the first section the words ' heretofore or ' would make the land entered for homesteads heretofore subject to this right. That however is not my intention. I do not desire to interfere with any rights now vested, or to interfere with lands for which the homestead entries have already been granted. I move therefore that the words ' heretofore or ' in the eighth line be struck out.

Minister of Railways and Canals, who has a department where there are many positions offering, to the fact that a considerable number of those who have returned from South Africa are disabled and many. of them without positions. I have one at present in my mind who belongs to my own county, who, as a commercial traveller was doing very well, who went to South Africa and lost a leg and who, since his return, of course, is incapacitated for his usual occupation. He, as well as many others, who have returned under analagous circumstances, is rather disinclined to apply for any position to the government. However, I think he did so on one occasion and was informed that not having conformed to the law as respects examination he could not receive a position.
I would recommend to the government if possible to entertain any applications coming from disabled soldiers. I think they are entitled to a great deal of consideration and when they do make application I think the fact that they have been through active service and been disabled should entitle them to the particular consideration of the government, as respects the disposition of the law requiring an examination for entrance to the civil service. I think if we had some assurance from the government that the cases of these returned soldiers would receive special attention, probably several of them who are unwilling to undergo the humiliation of a refusal would be tempted to make application. Every day the government is in a position to place civil servants and I think the cases of those who have been disabled in active service in South Africa, and there are quite a few in the country, deserve special consideration from the government.

The hon. gentleman forgot, as I pointed out to him last year, that .in addition to the $32.60 per ton, the country was giving a bonus of between $6 and $7 on the manufacture of the steel in this country.

That is what the hon. minister said. In that way the hon. minister in a moment agreed to give $15,000 more for the 25,WO tons of rails than Mr. Clergue had

offered to supply tliem for. Then, later than August, very close to the end of parliament -I think it was as late as October-an Order in Council was passed authorizing a contract for 25,000 tons at $32.00 a ton and for
100.000	tons more, at the market price, for the following four years. The hon. gentleman had agreed to pay the very large price of $32.00 per ton for 25,000 tons and Mr. Clergue was not able to deliver one ton. It is quite true that the hon. member for Algoma (Mr. Dyment), who intervened in the debate last year, stood up in the House and told us that he had just been up at the Soo and that everything was in readiness to deliver the rails and that delivery would begin in August.

25.000	tons is to be treated as if he had complied with his contract, and he is to get $32.60 a ton now when the hon. gentleman admits that he is able to buy rails at between $25 and $26 a ton. I wonder if the hon. gentleman thinks, that, in his own behalf, lie would pay, or that on behalf of any other person, he would be justified in paying out money in this way. WThat does the hon. gentleman say ? He wants a vote from this House for 25,000 tons of rails. He says he is going to pay $32.60 per ton for 10.000 and $28 per ton for the remainder. That would amount to $746,000 for rails alone, and the same item of the estimates includes fastenings at $50 a ton. How is the hon. gentleman going to pay for these 25,000 tons of rails which come to $746,000, besides a lot of fastenings when he is only asking for $600,000. That shows that these estimates are perfect nonsense. Where is the reason in submitting such an estimate as that to anyone who understands business and who knows what he is talking about ? The hon. gentleman stands up and tells us that he proposes to buy 25,000 tons of rails this year, that he is going to pay $32.60 per ton for
10.000	and $2S per ton for 15,000 tons and he only asks $600,000 to pay for them. How he is going to pay for these rails out of this $600,000 and pay for the fastenings as well, is something that I think requires a little more explanation.

I have to confess that my recollection of this matter is a little dim, because I have not had occasion of late to deal with the subject. My recollection is that at an early stage of the season-I forget at what particular date-Mr. Clergue discussed with the hon.	Minister	of	Railways	and	Canals(Mr. Blair), on behalf of the government, the question of assisting the starting of this Canadian enterprise by giving an order for rails. It was discussed with various members of the government, but chiefly with the hon.	Minister	of	Railways	and	Canals
asi his department was more particularly concerned, and it was agreed that an order should be given to Mr. Clergue for a quantity of rails at the then market price, whatever that market price was. My hon. friend (Mr. Barker) shakes his head, but I want to insist in this respect that my recollection is right. It was agreed that the rails should be taken at the market price when the arrangement was made and Mr. Clergue was so informed and it was so understood. But, it so happened that that was not expressed in a report of the hon. minister until a little later, and that the report of the minister was not expressed in an Order in Council until a little later. Hon. gentlemen make their comparisons as to the price of rails at the date of the passing of the Order in Council, and say that the price was too high, because, in the meantime rails had dropped in price. But it is necessary to remember that the price agreed upon, or the price at which the rails were contracted for, was the price of the market at the time the arrangement was made. It was a fair price, and the fact that rails subsequently dropped in price is something that might occur in any transaction.

with the arrangement. The bounty has nothing to do with it. If Mr. Olergue makes steel ingots he will get any bounty that is given by the government for the manufacture of steel ingots. He gets the bounty whether he makes rails or not. If the hon. Minister of Railways were buying steel rails he would have no difficulty in buying them from Mr. Clergue or anybody else at the market price and the bounty would have nothing to do with it whatever, so far as the hon. gentleman imports the bounty into the matter, it is unfair because it has nothing to do with it.

Therefore, as the bounty on iron and steel has not created the industry of manufacturing steel rails, something more is necessary. We have been paying an iron and steel bounty for the last ten or fifteen years and we have not yet had a rail made in Canada. It is an advanced process of manufacture. Therefore, the object of tuis government in making the contract was not merely to continue something that had already existed under the bounty, but to create another stage of manufacture, to carry the process further, and to bring about the manufacture of steel rails. I think that was a fair statement. My hon. friend will see that when he says the bounty was enough to create the industry of rail manufacturing, experience has shown that he is mistaken.

Mr. Clergue was the only intending manufacturer of steel rails in Canada, and we agreed with Mr. Clergue, irrespective of the bounty, to buy a quantity of rails at the market price at the time the arrangement was made. That was the basis of the contract, and that is what the Minister of Railways and Canals says he intended to do, and that is what he did do. The fact that the rails afterwards | Hon. Mr. FIELDING.
dropped in price proves nothing. In all commercial transactions the man who buys takes the risk of the price dropping, and if it does drop he may be sorry he bought so much, but that is a risk common to every one.

He defended that contract from one end of it to the other as a contract in the interests of the country. He said the price was good and favourable, that it was the lowest price at which the rails could be purchased. He stated that the general opinion was that rails were not on a falling market, but on a rising market. Now, as it happens, at that time there had been a large sale of English rails, English manufacturers had not been able to overtake the demand, and consequently they were not selling further rails. In the States production had overtaken the demand, consequently the rails were steadily falling. In the States rails had fallen within two months from $35 to $26 a ton, at the date on which the minister made this contract, he paid $7 a ton more than the price for which he could have got rails. Now, as Liberal-Conservatives and as protectionists, there is no reasonable limit to which we on this side of the House would not go to establish and protect a steel industry in this country. The difference between the two parties is that the Liberal-Conservatives would have made this contract openly, and adopted it as part of their policy. The government made this contract secretly, they covered up their contract and did not want the country to know it. There is the clearly defined difference between the two parties. Now let me show you that our contention was right as to the prices, and that the minister made his contract in a falling market. The price of manufactured pig iron in Canada during July, and up to the 28th of August, delivered at the Hamilton furnace, was $23 a ton; from the 28th of August to the 20 th of September, it was $20 a ton ; from the 20th of September onwards to October, and to the end of the year, it was $18 a ton : and to-day it is about $17 a ton. So there is a difference as between $23 and $17 a ton for the raw material. The price of rails in England kept up for some time, btit no English rails were sold on this continent because American rails were bought, the price being so much lower.
There is my direct statement as to the price of these rails on a certain date.

You have to put down rails, you will not have the earnings to do it out of, and how does it become any more capital charged in this way than it would if charged in any other way, when it has to be paid either out of the surplus Income of the year or out of bonds if there is not a surplus ? How are we to get the appropriation ? We have to put down the rails. I would not mislead parliament by saying that we are going to have surplus enough to meet that out of the earnings. If I do not ask it out of capital, how am I going to get it ? It simply means that you cannot do what is necessary to be done on the Intercolonial Railway at all unless you do it in this way.

They have a habit of dealing with what Mr. Mantilini calls 'the demnition total.'

As a matter of book-keeping it is desirable that there should be a broad distinction between revenue and capital, and I suppose that in the case of private companies it is essential the line of distinction should be clearly drawn. No doubt a company would every year lay aside a certain portion of its earnings in order to create a fund for the purpose of maintaining the road, and then, when it became necessary to renew the rails or do anything of that nature, there would be a fund available, which could be drawn on without touching the capital. But there is no such condition on the Intercolonial Railway. Without attempting to find fault with the
administration of hon. gentlemen opposite, as a matter of fact, when the present Minister of Railways took office, the railway was in a somewhat run down condition. At all events it was not up to date. It was not up to the conditions of a modern railway. It was just about then that the conditions of railroads on the continent of America began to experience a very material change. It was discovered that it was necessary to have better roadbeds, heavier rails and better grades and curvatures, larger engines-entirely different conditions from those which formerly prevailed. The Minister of Railways had to dp one of two things. Either let the railway go down and fall back in the race, or meet these new conditions by providing the money. * Since there was no fund available, my hon. friend had to draw his provision from capital or not at all. I do not see any means of getting over that. Is my hon. friend to be told that the large expenditures rendered necessary in order to improve the road and buy new engines and all that were to be paid out of the earnings ? My hon. friend knows that that is impossible. There is no other fund created, no reserve fund on which he could draw, and he had to get this money and charge it up to capital or go without it.

Let us see where the difference is. I say it is vital. This is a public work belonging to the people, and the Minister of Railways is just as much bound to show to the public exactly what it costs to operate and own that railway as are the directorate of any private company to show their shareholders the exact profit or losses. If we were to accept the theory of the Minister of Finance, we could make that railway show a profit of a million or two million dollars, by simply charging sufficient expenditure against capital account to produce that result. That would not make any difference to the treasury in the end, but the country is entitled to know exactly what really is the result of operating the road. I quite agree that when there is a very rapid increase of business, which causes additional expenditure, you must charge a portion of the expenditure to capital, but it is absolutely fallacious to cook the accounts of the Intercolonial Railway and make it appear that road is being operated at a profit, when instead it is being operated at an enormous loss.
[DOT]3803

The accounts last year showed that the toss on the Intercolonial Railway was about half a million dollars, whereas, if the accounts had been kept properly they would have shown a loss of twice, or, perhaps, three times that amount. I say that, in the interest of the country the accounts should be kept properly, so that the people may know exactly what it costs to own and run the railway. Let us not make the mistake of believing we are operating the road *on a paying basis when, as a matter of fact, we are adding to the debt of the country by millions of dollars. Operating it for the benefit of the country we may operate it indirectly at a profit, but we ought to know what it costs us in the ordinary railway sense to own and operate the road. I am surprised that anybody, above all the hon. Minister of Finance, should advocate any other course.

The Department of Labour issued their annual report some time ago, and I find an account of the contracts given out by the various departments. For instance, there is a list of :
Contracts entered into by the Department of Public Works during the year ending June 30, 1901, containing fair wages schedules end above cited conditions for the protection of labour.
There is a page and a half of contracts given out containing fair-wage schedules, but I find upon turning over to the list of the contracts entered into by the Department of Railways and Canals that while there is an extensive list of contracts containing the 'above cited fair-wages and other conditions for protection of labour,' there are no schedules to go with these contracts. To find out to what extent such contracts had been awarded, I moved for a return which was brought down to this House, dated March 11, this year. A number of questions was put to find out if possible on what conditions these contracts were let, and I find these answers :
The number of contracts in which the schedule of wages was prepared by the fair wages officers :	None. .
The number of contracts in which the schedule of wages was prepared by the contractors and accepted by the department :	None.
The number of contracts which were unaccompanied by schedules of wages : All.
I am not satisfied that the Department of Public Works should have all the credit for the enforcement of this fair-wage resolution that was passed by this House two years ago. As a matter of fact, nearly all the contracts now given out by the Department of Public Works contain not only that clause, but the schedule of wages current in the district in which the work is being carried on. I believe that the hon. Minister of Public Works (Mr. Tarte) could tell us that the Department of Labour looked after this matter. They have officers appointed and paid to prepare these schedules, who speak both English and French, so that they can handle all kinds of contracts in any district in the country. I think that if the Department of Railways and Canals will hand the matter over, as it should be, and as the Department of Public Works has done, to the Department of Labour, it will cause no more trouble in the department, and it will be satisfactory to all interests. In the Department of Marine and Fisheries, where they have different kinds of work to give out, there are no schedules, but there is this clause :
If this condition

That is the payment of wages current in the district.
[DOT]-is violated, the said party of the second part may cancel the contract and refuse to accept any work done thereunder.
In the Department of Railways and Canals there are no schedules or conditions what-

3S10
ever. In view of the fact that this matter has been passed upon by this parliament and that the fair-wage condition has been carried out successfully in the Department of Public Works, it seems to me only reasonable that the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals shall, as far as possible, have a fair-wage schedule put in.

If there had been any complaints that proper wages were not being paid we would have been in the position, under the general clause, to have called the contractor to account, and I think we would have been able to ensure the employees proper consideration at the hands of the contractors. But, since my hon. friend (Mr. Puttee) and others have been pressing on me the desirability, the justice and fairness of having schedules included in the contracts, I am not unwilling to give the matter my very best consideration as to the contracts which will be entered into in the future, in order to see what we can do towards meeting the wishes of these hon. gentlemen.

The Minister of Public Works requires dredges and many other things to carry on the deepening of the St. Lawrence, and he establishes works at Sorel in order to have these things constructed in our own country. Our contention is that the same thing should be done in the case of the Department of Railways and Canals.

He says there was a large amount of jobbing done, besides making locomotives, and several marine engines were made. He commences his statement with 1888, and gives the output of the locomotive works from that year down to 1893. I need not particularize every year.

Mr. Lee, who is the mechanical man in charge of the Kingston works, wrote as early as April 15, 1893, to the department stating that he had received the specifications of the two locomotives that were required, and he says that he will ' mail an offer for those two locomotives on the 17th of April if possible, on the 18th of April, at the latest.' Then I have a copy of the specifications. On the 9th of May, 1893, I see Mr. Pottinger wrote to this effect :
I have your letter dated May G, with reference to the locomotives. The matter has not yet been settled. It is now being considered by the department at Ottawa.
So they were able to furnish locomotives. Mr. Lee writes again to know whether they would take the two locomotives, and he is advised that the department has not yet settled the matter. Apparently when it was settled, it was against giving the order. I have a letter dated in August, written by Mr. Birkett, secretary treasurer, to the late Minister of Railways and Canals, in which he complains about the delay. He says he would like to have an opportunity of building those, and ' owing to the depression in the United States a number of men have returned out of work, and we could offer them work on a government contract,' and so on. They came from Cooke's. I have here also a memorandum which shows that instead of there being only one such purchase made, there was quite a number. The Kingston works commenced operation I think in 1875, perhaps in 1S73 ; I see where they furnished locomotives in 1875 to the government.

The works have been enlarged and I quite agree with the hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk) that the works might be still further enlarged in that direction. They have been greatly enlarged and they are doing more construction work there now. But, it must be remembered that with the extension of the Intercolonial Railway the repairs are greater than they were and they want more room. The original works, as established by Mr. Mackenzie and Mr. Brydges, in their day, must necessarily be more crowded to-day than they were then. There would necessarily require to be some extension of the works if the government enter into the construction of locomotives to a greater extent than at present. I quite agree with what the hon. gentleman has stated. I think it would be well for the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals to inquire into the matter as to whether the construction works should not be enlarged at that point. I do not speak from a sectional standpoint merely because Moncton is situated in the constituency I have the honour to represent, but it seems to me that in view of the character of the locomotives constructed in former years at Moncton, of their excellence and durability, it would be well that the works should be enlarged and that this work should be extended.

My hon. friend will see that in view of the urgent necessity there was of meeting the demands upon us, we were asking parliament for very large sums of money and we could not ask for an unlimited vote, we could not give priority to the enlargement of the locomotive works for the making of locomotives when we could get these elsewhere and use the money that parliament would be willing to vote for the necessary purposes of handling the traffic.

The minister must not forget that in 1900 we bought 1,300,000 ties, when the most we ever used in a year on that railway was 500,000; that we purchased 1,300,000 tons of coal, when the most we ever used in a year was 500,000 tons; and

that the purchases of stores in that year were enormous.

The bargain was that the manufacturers should get the benefit of the duty less $500. The Canadian Pacific Railway or any other company that brought in locomotives would of course have to pay the duty, while the government could bring them in free, and the Minister of Railways would get his locomotives cheaper if he got them in the States ; but that is the understanding we had with a (view to encouraging the industry in this country. Then, there is a very large amount of duty Which the locomotive manufacturer pays into the public treasury on his raw material, which the locomotive manufacturer in the United States does not have to pay; and it would not be fair to ask a Canadian manufacturer who has to pay a heavy duty on his raw material to compete in the open market with the United States manufacturer who has no duty on his raw material to pay. I think the hon. member will admit that it is a very good bargain. The hon. member for Hamilton suggests that the hon. Minister of Railways should replace all these worn-out engines with new ones of the kind he is buying. I would like to ask him if he thinks it would be fair for the purposes of comparison, or for the purpose of keeping proper accounts of capital and maintenance, that a 30-ton or 40-ton locomotive should be replaced by an 80-ton one.

They do not go into the fine points of putting the cost of one against the cost of another. When a business is improving so as to require larger locomotives they are very glad to have the opportunity of putting them in. If the hon. minister came here and said that he would even charge to revenue the old locomotive at its original value, putting the extra cost of the new, larger one, to capital account, nobody would probably find much fault with him. What we are finding fault with is that he is turning it all over to capital. I may say that the practice of the railway companies is also to set a new car against an old one, and I may add that the Grand Trunk Railway Company at their last meeting proposed to close their capital account altogether.

I am glad my hon. friend the Minister of Customs has made the reference he has, because it recalls to my mind a rather cogent fact. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company, knowing that the Kingston works were manufacturing locomotives for us, and ascertaining what price we were paying for them, offered us $3,000 in advance on the price we were paying if we would allow them to have a portion of those locomotives; but of course we could not spare them, and did not let them have them.
