Blair) moved for leave to introduce Bill (No. 104) to revise and consolidate the law respecting railways. He said : In introducing this Bill, of which I have given notice, I shall have to ask the attention of the House while I endeavour to give a brief explanation of its general character. The object is to establish a railway commission in Canada. It is not my purpose at this stage to enter into any elaborate argument to convince the House that the principle of the measure is one which ought to receive the assent of parliament, because I feel warranted in assuming, from the very general expressions of opinion which, for the last three or four years, have been made by hon. members on both sides, that this branch of parliament is disposed to look with favour upon the establishment of a railway commission in Canada, and I",,,,

than those Canadian producers who are utilizing Canadian railways and whose products are seeking the same markets; and they draw the inference that there must be ""some defect in a system which permits Canadian railways to carry those products from United States territory into another point of United States territory at a less cost per ton or per mile than it costs Canadian producers to carry goods to the same points. Naturally, therefore, they complain, and they complain loudly, and they are looking forward to the establishment of a railway commission in the expectation that it will tend to relieve them, to some extent at least, of this burden which they regard as onerous and unfair. You will see in this fact a sufficient reason, I think, to justify the opinion which prevails so largely in the province of Ontario as to the necessity of a railway commission. X expect that a commission of this character will afford a considerable measure of relief to people who are complaining in this way, though I fear it will not relieve them to the extent which they expect.
Now, having by way of preliminary, outlined the object, let us turn to the Bill. The Bill is largely framed for the purpose of constituting and putting into operation a railway commission. It also makes provisions with regard to a great many other matters. While it is a Bill to create a railway commission, it is at the same time a complete revision and codification of the existing railway law passed in 1888, and of all the amendments which have since been made. We thought that it was no use taking the subject up at all unless we presented in one single measure all the provisions of a general character which relate to the construction, the maintenance, and operation of our railways. There was need for a considerable revision of the existing law, not in particulars of great moment, but in many minor particulars which would contribute to the convenience of the board in carrying out the work of the commission, and aid them more efficiently to enforce the regulations, and which would be at the same time explanatory of certain provisions in the existing law about which there may be doubt. We have, therefore, had this whole law carefully revised and consolidated, and although the creation of a railway commission is the chief object, this and other points- have been taken up and dealt with at the same time. I think I may properly describe the Bill which is now submitted as a bona fide and earnest endeavour to create a railway commission with such powers and furnished with such jurisdiction as will afford the fullest possible opportunity of working out this question to a successful issue. We have had before us the experience of other countries, we have had before us the experience of England and of the various states of the union, as well as of the inter-State Com-

These have been studied and their defects have been examined. The difficulties in enforcing their laws have been ascertained, and so far as it was possible in our judgment we have made better provisions for successfully operating a railway commission.
With the enactment of this Bill, therefore, and I may say as a consequence of it, the present Railway Committee of the Privy Council passes away. It was not thought desirable that we should retain the Railway Committee to exercise any of the powers which it now exercises. There are some directions in which I think one who has acted upon that committee for some years might fairly say that the committee has done efficient work. I am not going to say that the Railway Committee of the Privy Council is an ideal tribunal. I think it -would be impossible for any ti'ibunal whose members are charged with all the duties and responsibilities of Ministers of the Crown, to do the work which devolves upon the Railway Committee in a thoroughly efficient manner. Still there are some branches of the duties heretofore imposed upon that committee which I claim they have most efficiently discharged. I think there, has been, and there will be, no grave complaints made against the efficiency of the Railway Committee unless it be in respect of the regulation and control of freight rates upon railways. Outside of that subject, I think the Railway Committee has discharged its functions efficiently, and in saying this I refer to the Railway Committee as it has existed at any time in the past as well as to-day. For myself I would not be disposed to listen to any reason for the abolition of the Railway Committee of the Privy Council did I not recognize, and did we not all recognize, tjiat that committee has not the time, nor the opportunity, nor the facilities for taking up minute questions respecting the control and regulation of traffic upon railways, and the rates and tolls to be charged by them; this is work that could be done more efficiently by a tribunal specially constituted for that purpose.
Now we propose to transfer to the board which constitutes the railway commission all the powers which are now possessed by the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, and as I shall point out to you, we are extending and enlarging these powers. As far as we have been able to gather from the experience of other railway courts of commission we have felt that there were defects which it would be possible to remedy and by extending and enlarging the powers of the railway commission over those which have been hitherto or elsewhere constituted we have thought that we have made a judicious move in the direction of improvement and grafter efficiency. We have, therefore, given them all the powers hitherto possessed by the Railway Commit-

tee, and added to those powers. We have introduced, it will be found, no doubt, entirely new provisions, and some perhaps which may be regarded by some lion, gentlemen as extremely radical. Some of these provisions we will examine a little later on. The chief features of this Bill then are the constitution of a railway commission and the regulation of tolls. These are the two main and capital features of the measure. As to the board of railway commission, we have defined what the constitutiou shall be and we have in this Bill defined the number of the commisioners, we have defined the tenure of office, we have declared under what conditions changes may take place and we have introduced other necessary provisions of that character, but, we have done so, I want to say now, with this intention in our minds :	We have
reached the best conclusion which we have been able to reach as to the constitution of the board and as to the other features which I have just mentioned, but, the main principle being maintained, we are not at all deceiving ourselves with the idea that we have exhausted all the wisdom iii the particular detailed provisions that we make in respect to these matters and we will be quite prepared in a spirit of fairness and liberality to listen, to weigh and to judge any suggestions which may be made to us from either side of the House. We have thought it necessary, in constituting a commission of this kind, that it slffnild be so constituted as that we will be able to secure the very best material which our country affords for this purpose. We feel that we ought to afford the widest possible opportunity within it to make the choice, because, Mr. Speaker, as this question impresses itself upon my mind, the character, the capacity, the wisdom and the selection of the men is everything. Unless this country can afford us men of the right stamp, men of independence of character, of firmness and of fairness, men who have experience in business, experience in railway operation, experience in law, unless the country can afford us these conditions, then, we cannot look with any reasonable hope to find that the operation of the commision will be successful. We have, therefore, to give to these men such a tenure as will invite the men that we want to come and take their seats upon this board. We have to give them a tenure long enough to induce them to give up any business in which they may be engaged and which may be profitable. Then, we have to pay them well. We have to give them a long enough tenure and we have to pay them reasonably well, because, if we do not do both of these things we cannot with confidence hope to secure men of the capacity and of the calibre that we require. Further, we propose that the board shall consist of three members. Perhaps, in the opinion of some lion, gentlemen, that will not be enough. That is a question that 774
we are not unwilling to consider, but it appears to us that three members of the commission, rightly selected and chosen are enough to dispose of the questions which will come before the commission, and to do it efficiently. We propose that the term of office of the three commissioners will be ten years, with eligibility to be reappointed, and that no member of the commission may be removed except upon an address of both Houses of parliament. We have not, in the Bill which will be laid on the Table, filled the blanks as to the age limit. We have not filled the blanks as to the salaries which will be attached, but it appears to us reasonable that with the commission constituted, the chairman, upon whom will devolve, I suppose, naturally, a somewhat heavier responsibility than that which will fall to other members, such as the responsibility which devolves upon judges and so forth, should be allowed an additional salary beyond that which we will allow to the other two members of the board. We have not filled the blanks, however, in regard to the age limit or to the amount of the salary.

33705,ca.proc.d.1902-04-09.1.5,1902-04-09,intervention,,,,RAILWAY COMMISSION.,,,"We have not defined the qualifications of the men. I was going on to say that in our minds, and it is proper that I should state it, because I am speaking with the authority of the government, and therefore what is said as respects the selection of the men for this purpose would be as binding as if it were contained in the statute, at all events, as it affects our appointments, that there ought to be on that commission one person having a somewhat lengthened experience in law, a man who would be qualified to fill a position on the bench. We have thought that if we could get a man who has had some railway experience, some experience as to railway legislation and railway operation, and as to questions arising in connection with railway controversies, so much the better. If such a man can be found, we ought to find him and he ought to be appointed. We think we ought to have a railway man also, and when I say a railway man I mean one who has not only been trained in railway work in all its branches, but one who would have considerable knowledge in reference to matters of transportation, traffic arrangements, freight rates and questions of that kind. We have thought that the third member of the commission should be selected from the general community, a man having some business experience in reference to transportation. I do not care to what particular class of business he may belong. I do not say that such a man need necessarily have been in merchantile life, that he need necessarily have been a manufacturer, or a large producer, a farmer for instance, who has had

large business with railways, but I would leave it open so that any one of that character, in any of these classes, who was found or believed to possess the necessary qualifications, might be chosen as a member of the commission. The powers conferred upon the board, I think I have already sufficiently indicated, and that I need not weary the House at greater length upon that point, further than to say this : That we have made some material changes in the existing law in a direction which we believe will commend them to all who have had anything to do with railway business and railway controversy. We are proposing that the railway commission shall have power finally to determine all questions of fact subject only to an appeal to the Governor General in Council. We do not believe that it would be expedient that this tribunal should have its decision on questions of fact subject to any revision by the courts, and for several reasons. In the first place, surely three gentlemen of the standing and character that I have named ought to be as competent as any tribunal you could set up to determine what the facts are in any given case which may come before them. If you grant an appeal, you allow a tribunal which has not heard the witnesses, and which has not special training and experience to determine upon the matter and to sit in judgment upon the findings of this specially qualified commission. I do not think that is expedient. Moreover, we hope that this measure will have the effect of very materially restricting litigation, which has been found to be a serious menace to the successful operation of the railway commission in the United States. Any one who has read the report of Mr. McLean will recollect his statement that taking the years in which railway commissions have been in operation in the United States, there has been an average of four years between the time when litigation is commenced and when it has terminated. We think it is desirable ; indeed we think it imperative on us to prevent the possibility of persons who feel they may have grievances against railways not being able to have their cases determined within a reasonable time. We have therefore asked parliament to say that the decision of this tribunal shall be final, subject only to revision by the Privy Council, and that there shall be an appeal to no other tribunal.
We propose in this Bill to give the power to the railway commission to control the rates. Under the present law the Privy Council fixes the maxima and minima rates-very seldom of course fixing minima rates but there are cases. Any variation which the railway company wishes to make within the maximum rate, they have it in their power at present to make that variation. We have provided here a new way by which we think that we will afford the fullest measure of protection to the persons Hon. Mr. BLAIR.
who are using the railway and to the railway itself. We propose to divide the traffic upon the railway into three distinct classes. First, there is the ordinary traffic ; second there is the commodity traffic ; and next there is the competitive traffic. With respect to the ordinary traffic which I think will be the largest portion of the traffic, we propose to confer upon the railway commission the power to fix or sanction what rates shall be charged. We propose to say that upon a schedule of tariff for ordinary traffic being submitted by the railway company to the board, the board may say that that rate shall be charged and that no higher rate or no lower rate shall be charged-except under conditions which are subsequently provided for. The railway commission will fix and control the rate for the ordinary traffic which embraces everything that is not specially regarded as competitive, and which is not specially included in the commodity traffic. What the commodity class means is this : The board may authorize certain classes of merchandise to be taken out of the ordinary traffic class and put in a special class to be called the commodity class ; or, having once put a certain article in the commodity class it may retransfer it to the ordinary class. As to the commodity class the board declares what shall be the maxima and minima rates and it is only with respect to the commodity class that that varying rate is permissive.

33707,ca.proc.d.1902-04-09.1.7,1902-04-09,intervention,,,,RAILWAY COMMISSION.,,,"All classes of goods which at the request of the shipper or at the request of the railway company, the board may think it desirable to take out of the ordinary class which is at a fixed rate of freight, and transfer to this commodity class. This commodity class is very well known in the operation of railways. We have decided that as to the control the board may exercise over this commodity traffic, it would be well that it should have the power to fix a maximum or minimum rate and between these the railway company may make its choice. When the company does make its choice, then while the schedule is !n force it must publish that schedule in the fullest possible manner ; post it in the offices and otherwise bring it to the knowledge of the public so that every one may know what the commodity rate is.
The competitive class is a class which it will be seen at once arises in connection with business to which no regular tariff can possibly be made to apply. We have got to recognize that the conditions are constantly varying and altering; new competitors are coming into the field, and a railway company cannot possibly be held strictly and rigidly to any particular rate when it is confronted with a keen and vigor-

ous competitor. As to competitive business, all laws recognize tliat there can be no arbitrary hard and fast rule laid down.
We are proposing to do in this regard what can only be done if you are to establish a working system at all, that is, to vest in the commission in whom we would be presumed to have confidence, the discretion of fixing the rate to be allowed to be charged by a railway in respect to its competitive business. The competition arises immediately in our own country, and also from outside in many cases. It may arise from railroads of from any other kind of transportation ; but the competition existing and being made known to the commission, it becomes the duty and the power of the commission to say what rate may be made ; and, in order that there may be no improper restraint upon the operating of the railways and the arranging of their rates, in order that the business may not be blocked, we have a clause which allows the railway company, when it is applied to for a competitive rate, to give it without consultation with the board ; but it immediately notifies the board of the rate fixed, and, if, the board approves of it, it remains tihe rate as respects competitive business on that class of goods until some other conditions arise. We have endeavoured to provide in the Bill against any unnecessary hampering of the operations of the railroads, and to afford them every means of meeting urgent, pressing demands, as they may arise.
We are proposing to irnpuse somewhat heavy penalties on the railroads in case they violate the provisions of this law. In order that the public may be kept fully informed of the tariffs that are in operation, we impose a penalty on any. railway company which does not see that every station is supplied with adequate notices of what these rates are.
The classification of freight traffic is another subject. At present all freight classification is practically determined by the Governor in Council. The railways now meet in their associations for the purpose of determining business. They agree among themselves upon what they call a joint freight classification, which is applicable to all the railways unless some are specially excepted ; and under the existing law the Governor in Council may confirm or may refuse confirmation of this classification, and changes may have to be made to meet the views of the government. We propose to transfer that power from the Governor in Council to the railway commission.
We have made provisions which we trust and believe will be found useful in respect to foreign traffic, as to which a great many complicated questions arise. We have vested a very large discretion, I may say full discretion, in the commission, as respects the regulation of both traffic from foreign countries into and through Canada, and traffic from Canada into foreign countries. We have provisions which, if enforced, will compel railway companies which have connections with lines running into other countries, to make proper and regular arrangements with those lines, so that there may be some uniformity and equity in the rates imposed on that portion of the traffic which may be Canadian and on that portion which may be carried through Canadian territory.
We have thought a good deal on the question of the long and the short haul, a question which is fruitful of complaint and a very difficult one to solve. The provision which we have made covering that intricate and complicated problem is to leave the railway commission to deal with each case as it arises, save and except that we forbid tihe imposition of higher rates for the shorter distance as compared with the longer distance when the shorter is included in the longer ; and we only except from the general operation of that clause those instances in which it has been made to appear-	'

I am afraid that some utterances of mine in this House may be found on record in favour of a railway commission. But they are utterances of long ago. At present I have a leaning in the same direction as the Minister of Railways (Hon. Mr. Blair), believing that the proper power to regulate these things, after all, is the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, a body that is more directly responsible to parliament, and not a commission appointed as a judge is or as the Auditor General is, and not subject to our correction or revision, not subject, above all, to our removal. As I understand it, the powers the hon. minister attempts to give to this commission include the power to fix tolls, and not only the fixing of the tolls submitted to them by a company for their approval, but the power of saying to a railway company : You shall charge no other rate than the rate we think is the right one. They are to have the fixing of the tolls for the traffic of all the railways throughout the Dominion. I suppose that when the power is given to that commission of fixing maximum and minimum rates, they shall be rates that shall apply equally, pari passu, to every railway in the Dominion, that they shall not have the right to say to one company : You shall charge such and such tolls and to another : You shall charge such and such tolls, but that there shall be a maximum and a minimum for distance, with the consideration which the minister proposes that there shall be this one class of freight and another that he calls commodity freight and another which he calls international or competitive. And I suppose that these rates, the maximum and the minimum, once fixed, shall be applied to all the railroads throughout the Dominion.

Mr. HAGGART.,,RAILWAY COMMISSION.,,,"As I understand the minister, he does not intend it to apply to government railways, but it is only applicable to other railways throughout the Dominion. I have not looked into the Bill, do not know its scope, but, to my mind, if that is the scope he proposes it to* have, the Bill is a very dangerous one. It may interfere seriously with private rights; it may
interfere with contracts which, at present exist between different railways and the government of Canada. It is true, we have the power of eminent domain in this parliament as much as they have in the Imperial parliament, and can exercise it as we please. But that right should never be exercised or be attempted to be exercised when it interferes with a contract solemnly entered into between the people of Canada and the different railways. I venture to say that a power of that kind given to a commission to fix rates absolutely at their own volition is a power which will interfere seriously with several such contracts which now exist. I shall not discuss the question fully, but shall look into this measure. But, generally, my predilection in these matters is the same as that of the minister. The hon. gentleman says that this Bill has been virtually urged upon him by petitions from the people of Ontario and the North-west, and that he doubts very much if the results which they anticipate will flow from the Act. I have no doubt whatever that those results will not flow from the Act. I am a firm believer in the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, and would prefer that, even as it is now constituted, to a commission. I think every considerable element in the country have confidence in the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, aside from all questions of which government may be in power, believing that both the interests of the railways and the interests of the public will be guarded and that justice will be faithfully administered. There is also the fact that I have just stated-that they are amenable to parliament and the people. But, this commission will be entirely independent of parliament, and I do not believe in constituting such a tribunal. I believe in not binding the future parliaments of Canada. I believe that future parliaments should be left with absolute power, as we have, and that we should not impose upon them a tribunal which they cannot alter or remove at any time. I do not believe in these officers being permanent officers receiving large salaries and not removable. That is the primary objection 1 have to the Bill. It has not been shown that this commission is a necessity in this country. I think the present tribunal which steps in between the railways and individuals in reference to freight, is a good one. If the Minister of Railways and Canals had a branch attached to his department specially for the purpose of looking into freight rates and correcting anomalies such as he mentions, it might be an advantage and assistance to the department. The minister states that another part of the Bill codifies the laws at present in force in order to simplify them, but without making any material change. The only real change, he says, the establishment of this commission, is called for by public opinion in Ontario and the Nortu-west ; he does not say that in Que-

He hardly boasts of being the parent of the Bill he introduces. It is evidently as he says, a Bill forced on him by public opinion, and one to which he does not give a very hearty sanction. I agree with him that there is not at present sufficient public opinion urging such a radical change as giving over the control of railways to a commission. As I understand him, this commission has larger powers than any other commission in the world. It has absolute power on every railroad in this country of fixing the maximum and minimum rates. If the law, or an Order in Council, fixed the maximum and minimum rates, and the regulation of the tolls within those extremes were left to a commission, it would be all right ; but to give to three or four men in this country the power of holding up every railroad in the country, without keeping them under parliamentary control, is a very serious matter. As I understand the minister, this commission are to have full jurisdiction over every question left to them, the only appeal is to the Governor in Council. Surely if the commission infringe upon any law of the country they ought to be subject to the courts of the land. I think they would be subject to the courts, notwithstanding this Bill, if the commission assumed to interpret a law, or if they did any act contrary to the law of the land ; I think then the court would step in and declare what the law actually is. However, it is an extraordinary power to give them. I suppose they have power to decide every question of fact. I do not know whether this Bill could remove that power from the courts altogether, I think the courts would decide whether the commission could exercise that jurisdiction. But so far as possible it is made a final court of appeal. It may be necessary in certain cases that it should be a court of final appeal. As I said before, I do not intend to discuss the Bill fully until I have seen all its provisions. But as far as I have heard the Minister of Railways and Canals, he has not yet offered any sufficient justification for tne introduction of the measure which he proposes.

So far as the general management of government railways is concerned, I do not
think that would be a reasonable proposition ; but government railways are in competition with other railways, and if the rates of these other railways are regulated by the commission, it is only fair that the rates made by officers of the government railways should be under the same control. I think the Bill would be very defective, and would not appeal to the sense of this House, if such an exception were made. I have heard a good deal of discussion in regard to the creation of a railway commission, and I have at times taken part in such discussion. I have never consented, in any observations that I have made, to the appointment of a railway commission, although perhaps a railway commission, organized under certain conditions, might be of great benefit. It would depend altogether on the constitution of the commission, and upon the powers delegated to it. The hon. minister, in describing the constitution of the commission, ns I understood him, said that it would l>e composed first of all of a gentleman versed in the law, another member would be a railway man, and in regard to the third appointment it seemed to me that the hon. minister was a little vague. It appears that the agitation which has brought this Bill into existence has come from the public and not from the railways. I take it'that the railways have not pressed upon the minister the establishment of a commission such as he has outlined. Now, I consider that the most important appointment upon that commission would be a business man, a shipper, a man who has had large experience in dealing with railways from a shipper's standpoint. As I said before, the composition of this commission is a very important matter, it needs to be composed of strong men mentally, intelligent men, men with broad views, and men who will be able to face, in the discussion of railway rates, some of the most difficult problems that have to be faced in commercial life. I confess that at this stage it is impossible for me to give my consent to this Bill, and later on I shall have more to say about it. I would like, however, to inquire from the minister what provision he has made for the public being heard before this commission. So far ns tlie Railway Committee of the Privy Council is concerned, I understand the greatest complaint of the public has been that they have not had an opportunity of being represented at the meetings of the railway committee, to make their interests heard and to see that such interests are considered. I think the Bill should have some provision in it by which the public may be represented in some manner.

INGRAM (East Elgin).,,RAILWAY COMMISSION.,,,"Mr. Speaker, unlike the hon. member for West Elgin (Mr. Robinson) I think I am quite within my rights in discussing this Bill in this House when I think proper to do so, and I propose to discuss it so long as I am complying with the rules of the House. I would like to say to the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals (Hon. Mr. Blair), that so far as I have been able to follow the statement he has made to-day, it is not clear as to whether the commission will have the power or the right to control the rates on government railways. I want to say to the hon. gentleman that unless his Bill is perfectly clear that the commission will have power to control the rates on government railways this Bill is of no use whatever, and he is making no improvement on the present system. I will show the hon. gentleman why I make that statement. This commission lias power to control the rates of the railways in this country. The Canadian Pacific Railway and the Grand Trunk Railway run east of Montreal to certain points. The Canadian. Pacific Railway state to a man who wishes to ship freight, that they will iShip that freight for so much a pound to an eastern point. The shipper may not be satisfied with the rate given by the Canadian Pacific Railway. He goes to the Grand Trunk Railway and asks them for their best rate on that freight. The Grand Trunk Railway gel from that shipper the amount the Canadian Pacific Railway are going to charge him and they say to the shipper that the Canadian Pacific Railway are violating the law by giving him a rate of that description. Under these circumstances their only redress is to appeal to the railway commission. They will enter a complaint before the commissioners and Hon. Mr. BLAIR.
they will expect to get redress. If they are dissatisfied they will appeal to the Governor in Council, which is the last court of appeal. The government railway is running out of Montreal. Does the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals mean to tell me, that, in case of an appeal being- entered before him as one of those interested in the decision of the Governor in Council, lie and his friends who have control of the government railway, are in possession of information which shows that notwithstanding the fact that the Canadian Pacific Railway had violated the law in giving ft rate which it should not have given the government railways are giving a rate that is much less than the rate given by the Canadian Pacific Railway ? The whole thing would be a farce, and let me ask if, in the framing of these rates, of which the commission have to approve, the hon. gentleman means to say that the government railways of this country are going to get an interchange of freight with western railways if they themselves are allowed to violate any rules they wish. They certainly would not. The only way you can administer the rates properly is by classifying the freights and rates uniformly, thus making every railway In the Dominion of Canada subject to the commisssioners. The commissioners must have full control, and if you do that, you can control the government railways. They certainly have been violating rates every year since I have been in parliament. The commissioners should be given the sole control, and there must be no indefinite sound on that question. I want to say that I did not rise for the purpose of discussing the Bill, but I wish to take this opportunity of impressing upon the hon. minister the fact that if he wants to meet the wishes of a large portion of the people of this country he must see to it that government railways must be more subject to the commission than they have been subject to the head of the department in the past.

Even if we had to pay $40,000 a year for a really first-class railway man to put at the head of that commission as chairman, it would be money well spent and the people of this country would reap immense advantage from it.k When we come to discuss the Bill in detail all these matters will of course be considered.

It is intended to settle a doubtful point as to the rights of the drawee with respect to the dating of his acceptance of a sight draft. Section 42 is as follows
When a Bill is duly presented for acceptance and is not accepted on the date of presentment or within two days thereafter the person presenting it must treat it as dishonoured by not accepting it ; if he does not the holder shall loc se his right of recourse against the drawer and endorser.
A doubt has arisen with respect of the right of the drawee to date the acceptance. The acceptance must be within the date of acceptance or two days thereafter. A doubt has arisen as to whether if he - accepts within the two days he must date his acceptance of the date of presentment, or as the date .he actually accepts.

That, in the opinion of this House, in the e^ent of a military force being sent from Can; ada to the approaching Coronation ceremonies, Hon. Mr. BORDEN (King's).
such force should be composed in its entirety of officers and men who have seen active service on Canadian contingents in South Africa.
He said:	Mr. Speaker, when I had the
honour of placing this resolution on the Order paper I thought I was doing an almost unnecessary act. But, to my amazement, I have seen within the past few weeks a statement made-whether ofliclally or not, I am not prepared to isay, but, no doubt, we shall hear this afternoon-that the men who placed their services at the disposal of the country in the hour of need are not to be regarded in the contingent that is to. be sent to the coming Coronation ceremonies. It will be a matter of surprise to the people if the fact is officially stated that those who, in the hour of the country's extremity without fear gave their services to the empire, are to be passed over when this contingent is to be sent to Great Britain. Scarce can be found a city, town or hamlet in this whole Dominion in which since this unfortunate war lias arisen, there are not people who have sorrowed at the loss of relatives in that far away land or have not rejoiced at the safe return of then-kinsmen who had gone upon their perilous errand to uphold the country's flag. 1 can hardly believe the statement, which, from time to time, appears in the press, that the Minister of Militia and Defence (Hon. Mr. Borden), I suppose, in consonance with the wishes of the ministry, intends to ignore the application of those who served with these contingents in South Africa and to give places on the Coronation contingent to men who have not seen active service. It will toe rather startling to know that the men who have returned from South Africa are to be left aside, and that carpet knights are to engage in the festivities that are to attend the great pageant which is to take place in Great Britain. I cannot and will not believe that this is to be done until 1 hear the statement made by the Minister of Militia and Defence himself. I trust that when the minister makes his oflicial statement on this subject the House and the country will be gratified by learning that every man who went forth in the hour of trial-for it was an hour of trial for Great Britain and her colonies-are to be first considered in forming the Coronation contingent, and that their places are not to he taken by men who were not, I will not say brave enough, but who were not ready, to go on that occasion. I await with considerable anxiety, as I know the whole country does, the statement of the minister. And, in the further remarks which I may make, 1 trust that I shall be able to offer commendation and congratulation to the minister that he has made the statement that every man who tendered his services on the contingents for South Africa, whether as a private or as an officer, and who wishes to go to Great Britain as a member of the contingent on the occasion of the Coronation, will be ac-

cepted, provided tliat lie liad the honour and glory of serving on behalf of his country in the South Africa troubles.

However, that does not matter very much. My hon. friend says that, in his opinion, the contingent that is to be sent to the Coronation to represent the Canadian militia should be composed exclusively of men who have served in South Africa. I would like to ask my hon. friend why he would exclude the men who served, for instance, in the North-west rebellion V They served their country as faithfully as did those who went to South Africa. It seems to me that to state the proposition of my hon. friend is to at once make evident the answer, and that answer is that, while we should include in the Coronation contingent representatives of the different corps that have served in South Africa, it is equally important that we should include representatives of every part of the Dominion and all branches of the militia-that, in fact, you should make this Coronation contingent thoroughly representative of the militia of Canada as far as possible. My hon. friend speaks of ignoring the men who fought in South Africa. There is no intention of ignoring them. But my hon. friend wants to ignore the scores of men who wished to go to South Africa but could not get an opportunity to do so. I think that those men who were denied the opportunity of going to South Africa have a right to representation on the Coronation contingent as well as those who did go to South Africa. All I can say now to my hon. friend and to the House is that I propose to recommend to the government that we should send a contingent composed of 580 men, representative of all the different branches of the Canadian militia; that the different corps in the various districts of [DOT] Canada should be fairly represented numeri-* cally; that the selection should be made with reference to the numbers enrolled in rbhe militia in each district; and that we will
endeavour to have it truly representative of the force of this Dominion which will show to the people of England and to the people of the empire as clearly as possible the kind of militia force we have in this country.
I repeat that we shall take care that fair representation is given the men who have done such splendid service in the war in South Africa.

There is no doubt that the eyes and the attention of the Canadian people are to-day very much on those men. They have given evidence, not only of their loyalty to the country, but of their desire to maintain the prestige of the country, to maintain British law and British order in a very distant part of the empire. In doing so they have been obliged to undergo perils and hardships that are not usually incident to the militia service of the country; and if any recognition could be shown them beyond that which is shown the ordinary militia man in Canada, I am quite sure it would meet with the approval of the Canadian people, and agree with what they regard as a sense of justice. I think there is a good deal in the contention of the hon. minister that the various portions of the militia force should be fairly represented, because in going there they will be regarded as samples of the militia of Canada belonging to the various branches. But it might not be possible to do that properly if you confined the selection to those who went out to South Africa. Still, there is no doubt many will have the privilege of going by virtue of the influence they will be able to bring to bear upon the Minister of Militia and Defence, and the influence which these young men can bring to bear upon that same power if they desire to go. While the South African men might not command the same attention and indulgence that others do, I think that in consid-

eration of what they have done for the country, every allowance should be made for them, and other things being equal, as many as possible of the young men who went out to maintain law and order in that distant country should be selected for the contingent.

When X placed the order on the paper in that way, saying that the force should be composed in its entirety of those men, it was because X did not know how many the government proposed to send, and I thought that, of all others, those who had gone out to South Africa should have the first claim. Talk about the corps being representative, talk about it being regarded with great applause in Great Britain by reason of its being representative of all the various corps of the militia, I tell the minister that if it were known that every man who marched in procession under the Canadian flag and under the British flag, had borne arms in South Africa, the hurrahs of the crowd would be much greater than if it were known that they were simply marching as representatives of the different militia corps of this country. The minister smiles. Well, Sir, all I can say is that I do not believe it will be regarded as a smiling matter throughout this country when it is known that gentlemen are about to attach themselves to the corps of this country in order to take part in this most peaceful errand, on this junketing tour, at this time when everything of the best will be at their disposal, and who, I am bound to say, in many instances, never threatened the government or any department of the government with an intimation that they wished to go under the guns in South Africa. Now, regarding the question of the North-west representatives, the force is going to be a large one, some 550 men, and I am bound to say that if other applications are received than exclusively from men who have been to South Africa, there will not be many vacant places for men who are in the North-west. Once again let me say there are young men in every town and county in all the provinces who haVe been to South Africa, and I say it is unfair to them, when they were prepared to give up the best they had, to risk their lives and give up their situations in many cases, that now when there is to be this gorgeous pa-Mr. SPROULE.
geant in Great Britain, these young men are to be told by the minister that because they are not representative Canadians from a militia point of view, a place of honour is to be denied them. I say the feeling in Canada is universal that no more representative men could be found for the contingent than the men who, in the hour of trial, were ready to go under the guns and under the British flag in South Africa. X trust that even yet the minister will change his opinion, and will say that every man who can show that he has been in the South African war will be given an opportunity of going.

If the hon. minister will put it to the applicants who are anxious to go to the Coronation, I have sufficient confidence in the appreciation of the volunteers of Canada to feel that they will all give way so that those who stood under the guns, to use that expression, and went out and risked their lives, while many of their comrades remained at home, may have an opportunity of going and that they will all say : ' If there are not enough places to go around, send the boys who went out and represented the country in this war. I cannot see why those who served in South Africa ought not to have the first choice ? I do not believe it is probable that as many as 5S0 will apply but if we did not give any special recognition to those who had performed that splendid service in South Africa, I think it would show that we were wanting in appreciation. It is all very well for us here in this happy land, in this peaceful country, so far away that we cannot hear the thunder of the guns there ; we remain here, but those boys of their own accord went out and represented us as volunteers. If we had sent out 5,000 instead of 1,000, and I would like to have seen 5,000 sent out, or 10,000, they would have rallied as is shown by the number
18	r_S
mustering for this latest contingent. It is only fair that we should extend some consideration to these volunteers and if we did not do so I think we would be wanting in appreciation. That is the only ""eason why I am saying this just now. I am sure that if there are enough of those who performed this voluntary service in South Africa to fill the contingent, that others will be willing to take second place and allow them to go. Let me add one word to what was said by the hon. gentleman i.Mr. Bennett) who brought this motion forward. If you send 580 of the boys who were in South Africa with their uniforms they wore when they came back, many of them soiled, some of them blood stained, nothing would be a greater addition to the parade and nothing would more please the people of Canada and the people of the British empire than an exhibition of that sort. I would not care if the contingent were not quite so representative in one sense as in another. What do they represent ? How did we get our liberties and how have they been held V How have Christianity and civilization been spread ? We have helped to hold them. We haye helped by legislating here but had it not been for the men who have gone without consideration of danger of hardship or death to bear their share in battle this, British empire would not have been what it is, and but for such actions could not remain. So, I say that we should offer the first choice to the boys who deserve it most, and if they do not fill the places, then send others.

Not only have we these men in Canada who have seen service in South Africa, but we have large numbers of men who saw service in the North-west rebellion, and before that in the Fenian raids. Had the motion of the hon. member for East Simcoe (Mr. Bennett) been to the effect that those men should be chosen from the thousands of men who had seen active service in defence of Canada or the empire, then, I would have felt disposed to support it, but as I understand it he wishes the whole contingent to be drawn from those men who saw service in South Africa. To me this seems to be a decided reflection upon the rest of the militia force in Canada. We have in the active militia to-day some 40,000 men all told and but a small portion of these men have seen service in South Africa. Whenever a call has been issued to the volunteers for active service in South Africa that call has been responded to by two or three times the num-

ber of men who were able to go, and yet this resolution would prevent the acceptance of those men who volunteered for service but whose services were not accepted simply because the number was limited.

I have them in my own regiment and if there was a large number of men in the militia who never volunteered to go to South Africa I defy hon. gentlemen opposite to say that it was cowardice that kept them from volunteering. They did not volunteer to go to South Africa for the good and sufficient reason that in many cases they had obligations at home which made it impossible for them to volunteer. And yet for years past these same men have been keeping up the militia force of Canada and have made it possible to send to South Africa these contingents which have brought such credit to our arms. This resolution proposes to turn down some 30,000 active militia men in Canada. It proposes in the case of the fine regiment in the county which my hon. friend (Mr. Bennett) represents, to select some eight or ten men and to exclude 400 men who have done good service in the militia ranks of this country. In the case of my own regiment we have had some fifteen who volunteered and accepted service in South Africa, but we have 400 others to consider, and I for one would never consent to a motion of this kind which would debar these brave men from any participation in this Coronation trip, which has been so disrespectfully spoken of by the hon. member for East Simcoe as a junketing tour.

I tii ink that the question of physique and appearance as well as bravery comes in on an occasion like this. I can quite understand the pride of Canadians in seeing that their country is represented by fine looking men at this ceremony, and for that reason a little latitude should be given in the choice. Sometimes a very small man may be a very good fighter, but he would not be taken as a specimen of the physique of the Canadian people. I am not boasting because I happen to be tall myself, but I take a little pride in the fact that the stateliness and athletic appearance of our Canadian people ought to be represented in that corps. For that reason we should modify this resolution. While we may give the small men a chance later on we want to give the big fellows a chance now.

To-day, I believe, a sad funeral cortege will be wending its way through the city of Halifax to the county of King's, which the Minister of Militia represents, bearing the body of young Lieut. Beverley Webster, late of the King's Own Regiment (a son of the opponent of the present Minister of Militia at the last election), a young officer who lost his life in the service of his country while holding a commission in the imperial service, which I believe was secured for him by the Minister of Militia. Two of three of our young men in Halifax have sacrificed their lives for their country while connected with the imperial troops. I may mention the names of young Lieut. Wood and Lieut. Hensley, who offered up their lives for their country in the South African war. Surely it is not well that we should forget that these young men have added lustre to the name of Canada. Surely it is not necessary for us to pass a resolution here to* say that any particular branch of the service should be exclusively represented in the corps to be sent to the Coronation. I might also say that in the regiment at present garrisoning Halifax nine-tenths of the men would be delighted to be allowed to go to South Africa.

I therefore say that it is not proper that we should make any distinction on this occasion. I believe we can safely leave it to that minister, who has laid upon the altar of his country such a great sacrifice, to select such men as he may deem proper to represent Canada.

The object is not to show to the people of Great Britain the physique of Canadians, because they are already well satisfied with that. The object being therefore to send representatives from every branch of the service, that can only be attained by following the suggestion offered by the Minister of Militia. No one would be more delighted than I, to give due preference to those Canadians who have served in the defence of the empire. No doubt the hon. minister will select, as he has stated he will, principally from the ranks of those who have served in South Africa ; and I for one would say, select liberally from those ranks, while at the same time giving others in the different branches of tlie ^service a right to be selected.

BORDEN (Halifax).,Leader of the Official Opposition,QUESTIONS.,THE CORONATION CONTINGENT.,,"I do not quite understand why the contingent will not be representative of all the branches of the service in Canada if the men are selected in accordance with the suggestions made in this amendment. We are told by the hon. Minister of Militia that he desires this body of troops to be a fair representation of all the branches of the service in Canada. Well, I ask him whether it is not true that the contingents which have already gone to South Africa do fairly represent all the branches of the service in Canada ? If that is true, it seems to dispose of every objection
raised also on that score by the hon. member for Haldimand, who states that 90 per cent of tlie men who have gone to South Africa are from volunteer regiments. That being the case, you have all branches of the service-infantry, cavalry, and artillery represented by them. My hon. friend from Annapolis (Mr. Wade) made a suggestion which does not seem to have any practical bearing on this matter. He says that a number of our young men are serving in the imperial forces. That is true, but I do not see how the government of Canada can select them for this purpose. The motion of my hon. friend from East Simcoe probably required some modification. I agree that the men who served in the defence of their country in the North-west rebellion should be considered. But this particular occasion is one with which the empire is specially concerned, and the war in South Africa was one in which the whole empire was concerned. The ceremony that is to take place in London will have a particular significance in that respect, inasmuch as it concerns not the British Islands alone, but every portion of tlie empire as well. Therefore, I did regret to hear the Minister of Militia say that no special recognition is on this occasion to be given to the services of the Canadian troops in South Africa. It seems to me, without slighting for a moment the services performed by the gallant sons of Canada in the North-west in 1885, that the service in South Africa is one to which special significance should be attached in connection with the ceremony which is to take place in June next; and when that force comes to be constituted, I hope special consideration will be given to the men who were engaged in that service. I do not for a moment desire to say a word in depreciation of the volunteer force of Canada or of the men who sought to serve in South Africa and were not afforded an opportunity to do so. I know that there are many such men in Canada-men who deserve well of the country ; but, notwithstanding that, I think the men who did go to South Africa and face the foe there and who performed their duty in such a way as to make the name of Canada a household word throughout the length and breadth of the empire, should be principally considered in the making up of this contingent which is to visit the mother country. I say that from the standpoint of the best interests of Canada and the empire. I think there is a great deal in the observation which has been made to-day that special attention would be given to our Canadian troops in June next in London if it were known that those troops were selected principally from among the men who had fought for the empire in South Africa. I hope, therefore, that the minister will give this matter a little further consideration, and that the expression of opinion he has made to-day will not be regarded by him as final.

The reason I make this appeal to my hon. friend is that I have been appealed to myself, especially from my own province, against the passage of the Bill ; and, to be perfectly candid, I must say to my hon. friend that I was a little prejudiced against it before I had taken cognizance of it. I was under the impression that it was going so far as to compel the medical profession in all parts of Canada nolens volens, to be incorporated ; but I see that subsection 3 of section 6 contains a provision which leaves the medical profession in any province free not to become part of this corporation. This in my estimation ought largely to remove the objection which existed in some quarters against the wide scope of this Bill. Therefore, I would suggest to my hon. friend that the Bill be left on the Order paper, so that before it goes to the final stage it may circulate amongst the medical profession, especially in the province from which he and I come, in order that they may become acquainted with it; for I think my hon. friend will agree with me that it would be exceedingly inadvisable to carry the Bill to a hasty conclusion, without giving the profession ample opportunity to familiarize themselves with it, and, if', it is not absolutely free from objections, to

[DOT]2478
make suggestions which would render it acceptable. The Bill is a very wide one, but I think it will on the whole serve a good purpose if it can be shown to be free from the objections which have been urged against it.

I have seen some communications from the province of Quebec, signed by a few medical men who are opposed to it for some reason or other ; but, outside of these few men, I believe the great bulk of the medical profession throughout Canada are strongly in favour of it, and X do not think it should be delayed except for really important reasons. The hon. premier has indicated that he himself had some little prejudice against it, but that that prejudice has now been removed. That being the case, I think he might now urge upon his friends from the province of Quebec the great desirability of this measure. I think I am safe in saying that not only thousands of medical men in the other provinces, but also the vast majority of the profession in the province of Quebec, are in favour of it ; and its passage should not be delayed except for some good and valid reason, and not because of some little prejudice by which the medical profession are sometimes liable to be actuated-I say that with all respect to my hon. friend beside me (Mr. Roddick). The demand for this measure comes from one end of the Dominion of Canada to the other. I believe it will be found that one thousand medical men are in favour of it for every one who is opposed to it. Therefore, I wftuld ask my hon. friend the leader of the government to facilitate the passage of this Bill at the earliest possible moment. I think I am safe in urging this, on the authority of the total medical profession of the province of Ontario and right through to the Pacific Ocean. Our desire is that Canada should be one country, and this Bill is one of the means of bringing about that end, and it should not be hampered by any little prejudices. Therefore, I would appeal to the premier to endeavour to remove the objections which are entertained against the Bill, and to allow it to go through at the earliest possible moment.	.

We are departing-from the principle that has hitherto existed governing the medical profession, and therefore I think that before it becomes law we should take care that all parties interested be made fully conversant with its provisions and be given the opportunity of expressing their views should t^iey object to any of them. The Bill before the committee is not that which was introduced, as considerable modifications have been made. It provides specifically for provincial co-operation, in order to make it effective, we should see that the medical bodies which exist in the provinces, whose co-operation is required, should be given every opportunity to give it their careful study. It is not a question of consulting a few people in the province of Quebec. This is considered a serious matter in many of the provinces outside Quebec, and what we have to do is to educate the people of the different provinces to the idea that this is intended for their benefit, and to remove from them any idea that it in any way affects the privileges they now possess.

I do not know that hon. members generally have perhaps appreciated sufficiently the importance of this measure, and sent it out to the medical boards in their different counties. The difficulty that I see in connection with the Bill is simply that it is dealing with the subject of education, which is one of those that have been delegated to the provinces.

If I felt sure that this was no encroachment on provincial autonomy, I should gladly support it. I think that the medical profession of the province of Quebec are largely in support of this measure, but we are naturally and reasonably jealous of any encroachment on the rights specially delegated to the provinces by the British North America Act. If that objection be removed, I believe that the Bill will be beneficial in its operation, and perhaps the medical profession in Quebec would realize more advantage from it than the medical profession in other parts of the Dominion, for this reason that our young men are proficient in both languages, and as in all our provinces there are localities where there Is a mixed population, a young doctor from the province of Quebec could practice his profession in such mixed communities with greater chance of success than a practitioner tied down to one language. On the other hand, however, I believe in provincial autonomy. I believe in preserving all the rights guaranteed to us under the constitution, and if there was any possibility of this measure being an invasion of that automony, I should be opposed to it. I think that the suggestion of the right lion, the Prime Minister that this Bill should stand over until the medical profession in the various provinces have had time to study it in all its bearings, is a wise one. Nobody is anxious to take any hasty step or to invade in the slightest degree provincial rights or autonomy, and I am therefore quite willing tcf support the suggestion of the right hon. gentleman that the Bill should stand over for the time necessary to give the different medical boards the opportunity of studying all Its provisions.

Several French Canadian practitioners in the city of Montreal have told me that they were anxious to see it passed, as they believed it would be of great use to themselves, but none the less is it desirable that all parties interested should be given an opportunity of thoroughly studying it. I see no objection to our letting it stand over for the short delay required. I do not agree with the hon. member for Sliefford (Mr. Par-melee) that the question of education is touched by this measure. So far as I can understand, the Bill is not an educational Bill in any sense of the word. We would oppose it if it were. I think it is more a Bill coming within the purview of this legislature under the first part of section 94 of the British North America Act. It does not come under section 93 in any way, and I do Mr. PARMELEE.	'
not think it conies under section 92, but, as I have stated, under the opening lines of section 91. A subject which is for the general interest of Canada, I should call it.

Prime Minister to facilitate my going on with this Bill at an early day. Thursday is now taken by the government, to-morrow being the first Thursday so taken. Otherwise this Bill would have come up to-morrow. So, it is pretty hard for one advocating this Bill to have it put off to-night when it could be taken up, unless the government will assist me to go on with it at an early day. I think I am entitled to ask that.

Minister to the fact that there are a number of Private Bills on the Order paper. I understand that we are likely to have but one day a week devoted to business other than government business.

We are coming to the point of the session, when I think we can reasonably hope for the blessing of prorogation. But. if my hon. friend is here on Monday evening, probably the order of Public Bills and Orders will be reached. I see on the Order paper very few notices of motion that are likely to be debated. Of course, I cannot say with certainty, but I think it probable that Public Bills and Orders will be reached, and then my hon. friend will have an opportunity to discuss the items to which he refers.
