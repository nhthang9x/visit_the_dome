Mr. LaRIVIERE. It was understood that I should be invited to this meeting of the Standing Orders Committee, but I was not notified and I knew nothing whatever about it.

Clifford Sifton) moved for leave to introduce Bill (No. 133) to amend the Rocky Mountains Park Act, 1887. He said : The Bill is for the purpose of enlarging the boundaries of the park. The present park is 260 square miles, or 166,400 acres. That is, as the House will see, considerably less than 20 miles square. The suggested park including the present one, will be 4,900 square miles, or 3,136,000 acres. But alongside of that on the British Columbia line we have by Order in Council set apart a portion of the railway belt of British Columbia, extending down to Field, under the name of the Yolio park, which is 832 square miles, or 532,480 acres. The suggested park and the Yoho park combined will amount to 3,668,480 acres. I may say that the number of visitors to the park is increasing very rapidly, and it is found that it is likely to become a place of very considerable resort, *especially for American tourists. We have a thriving herd of buffalo there and a number of other animals, such as moose, elk, a couple of varieties of goats, and we are trying to get together a collection of animals that will be attractive. We find that these animals are exceedingly attractive to visitors. It is the opinion of everybody who has visited the park that it would be a great mistake to let it go any longer without increasing the boundaries to a sufficient extent to have room to carry out the original intention. I lay a map on the Table, so that members can look at it for themselves.
Mr. LaRIVIERE. What will be the shape of the park when it is enlarged ? Will it be square ?",,,,

At present the appeal from a single trial judge is to the court in British Columbia. It is extremely inconvenient to the people of the Yukon
to be obliged to come down to British Columbia for the trial of their appeals. If this resolution is passed, a Bill will be introduced which will provide for three judges of the Territorial Court who will form a court of appeal, the appeal from them being to the Supreme Court of Canada.

As to the second portion of the resolution, my hon. friends are aware that, under the existing law, a High Court judge becoming incapacitated at any time after he has entered upon his duties is entitled to receive his retiring allowance. He is also entitled to retire after fifteen years on the bench. But, in the case of county court judges in Ontario, we find that one of these judges cannot be given retiring allowance until after he has served ten years. A judge may become incapacitated through illness and be obliged to retire, yet not receive any allowance. It will be seen that that is a hardship. There are cases of special hardship which will be met by this amendment. One case, I think, is a case of extreme hardship. I think my hon. friend will admit that it is proper that if a judge becomes incapacitated, whether he be in the High Court or in the County Court, he should be entitled to a retiring alowance.

37563,ca.proc.d.1902-04-23.7.10.2,1902-04-23,intervention,,,,QUESTIONS.,PENSIONS TO NORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE.,,"When this Bill was in committee before, sections 7 and 5 were reserved. Section 7 provides that if an officer is constrained ^ to leave the service before a period at which a pension may be granted to him. by reason of severe bodily infirmity through no fault of his own, and* in the discharge of a public duty, the Governor in Council may allow him a pension not exceeding three months pay for every two years service. Section 8 provides that the Governor in Council may grant a pension Hon. Mr. FITZPATRICK.
to the widow and children or any officer who, having completed twenty years service, was at the time of his death in the receipt of a pension. It was suggested at the time that with regard to widows of officers who had been disabled before the period of twenty years, it should be made compulsory upon the government to allow a pens'011- This is practically what is done by * . ilU;, ,The wording of it Is ' may ' instead ot shall. The reason why we have used tlie word, may ' is tlint there may be reasons why a pension shall not be given. But in every case where no such reasons exist it is expected that the widow will be entitled to the pension. With regard to section 5, it provides :
If any officer is constrained, from any jnfir-mity of body or mind, to quit the force before a period at which a pension might be granted to him, the Governor in Council may allow him a gratuity not exceeding one month's pay for each year of his service ; and if any such officer is so constrained to quit the service before such period by reason of severe bodily injury, received without his own fault, in the discharge of his public jluty, the Governor in Council may allow him a gratuity not exceeding three months' pay for every two years' service.
The point was made, I think by the hon. member for Toronto, that there was here an invidious distinction The Bill provided that if a man had been twenty years in the service then he may retire with his pension. He may be in comparatively good health, but having served the country twenty years, he is entitled to his pension.' It was suggested that if an officer, after twenty years of service, is in good health and is still entitled to his pension, why should we not do the same thing for an officer who lias been disabled in the service of the country before he has been twenty years* in the service. Well, this Bill provides for pensions to those who have served the country for long periods. The intention is that officers shall contribute to a fund, and it is expected that a fund will be created which will be self-supporting. But there may be cases where a man has not served twenty years, he may have served only nineteen years or ten years, and may be disabled in the performance of his duty, and then it may be said : Are you going to turn that man adrift and do nothing for him ? Why not provide for him ? The reason we do not provide for him in this way is because the Act is intended to give pensions for long service only. But I may say to the committee that those who have served the country and been disabled, are not turned adrift. Since 1885 we have always provided for cases of that kind. We have adopted in that respect the law which regulates the militia, a provision has been introduced in this Bill exactly like that which is found in the Militia Act. In 1885, an Order in Council was passed under the Militia Act to provide pensions for officers who have been disabled in the rebellion

of that year. In 1886, a similar Order in Council was passed adopting the same rule and the same rates of pension for officers of the mounted police who had been disabled during that rebellion. The Order in Council reads thus :
 On the 19th of May, 1886, an Order in Council was passed providing that the members of the mounted police and Prince Albert volunteers who were wounded, and the families of those who were killed during the troubles in the North-west, be granted compensation in the same manner, and upon the same scale of gratuities and pensions as was provided for the active militia by the Order in Council of the 8th July, 1885.
Under this order is another order. We have every year in the estimates, including this year, taken an appropriation to cover all cases of disabilities occurring in the mounted police while in service. If members of the committee will look at the estimates of this year, page 37, item 108, they will find an appropriation of $2,510.03 to cover pensions payable in connection with the North-west rebellion of 1S85. They will find also, in the same item, appropriations of $109.50 and $182.50 for widows and children of members of the mounted police killed in the performance of their duty. Again on page 70, item 242, there is an appropriation of $2,000 as compensation to members of the North-west Mounted Police for Injuries received in the discharge of duty. At present, under these three heads, we have given pensions to members of the mounted police who have been killed and injured in the rebellion of 1885. We have sixteen pensions for which we ask appropriations this year as follow's :
Major Moore, loss of leg, pension, $800 ; Private Newitt, shot in leg, $91.25 ; Mrs. A. Anderson, son killed, $91,25 ; R. Middleton, son killed, $91.25 ; Mrs. M. A. Smith, son killed, $91.25 ; Private Pembrun, loss of arm, $109.50 ; P. W. H. Smart, father killed, $109.50: Sergeant Ward, shot through lungs, $328.50 ; Sergeant Fury, shot in chest, $219 ; Sergeant McRae, shot in leg, $164.25 ; Constable Pocock, lost part of foot, $83.95 ; Constable Loasby, shot in body, $S3.95 ; Special Constable Harpur, rheumatism, $219 ; Mrs. Burke, husband killed, $136.88.
Then w'e have in the estimates pensions to Mrs. Grundy* and Mrs. Colebrooke, names w'hich have not been forgotten, of men who lost their lives in the rebellion, and their widows receive pensions of $109 and $182. Then we have also a certain number of pensions to men w*ho have not been killed or injured but who have been disabled. Under such circumstances I think we had better leave the law as it is, because no wrong has been done so far, and it is found that in every case parliament, at the suggestion of the government, has provided for relief in the manner contemplated in that section. This is a reproduction of the law respecting pensions for the militia.

After he has completed twenty years of service as provided in section 8. and if he is on a retiring allowance and dies, the widow has no right to any pension nor the children to any compassionate allowance if the government do not choose to give any. In reference to the exceptions provided in section 9 there is a great deal of certainty, and under section 8 the widow and children are still dependent on the good-will of the government.

I have thought proper to vary the language slightly, but the purport of the motion remains unchanged. Before proceeding to discuss this motion I had better perhaps read it, so that the House may be in possession of the features that it contains. It is as follows :
This House is of the opinion that British supremacy should be maintained and firmly established in South Africa, to which end Can-

ada has cheerfully contributed men and money. Having in view the effect of a policy of magnanimity and mercy at the cession of Canada, and at the close of the civil war in the United States, and for other reasons ; this House is also of the opinion that in the interest of peace and of future tranquillity, harmony and homo-geniety in South Africa, the broadest policy of magnanimity and mercy may be extended to a brave foe now opposing British arms, upon condition of submission to British control. And upon this opinion, humbly presented with the prayerful hope that it may aid in securing a favourable and honourable settlement of South African difficulties ; this House invokes the considerate judgment of His Gracious Majesty the King.
The question, Mr. Speaker, is brought before the House in this manner and at this time, for the reason that another opportunity will not be afforded during the present session. It is not offered as a motion of want of confidence ; it is not offered in any sense as a motion having political significance or having anything to do with the policy of the party in power in this country, or with the policy of the opposition. The resolution, it will be noticed, provides expressly for submission and for the establishment and maintenance of British authority in South Africa. It is not a pro-Boer motion ; it is not a motion that in the remotest degree would counsel the' establishing of Boer independence or the establishing of any condition of things in South Africa except British supremacy. At my request the motion will be seconded by a gentleman who, in my opinion, as fully as any other member of this House perhaps, represents French Canadian sentiment. I move the motion as an English representative ; the gentleman who will second the motion,
I have asked to second it because he is a representative French Canadian. I am happy to say, Mr. Speaker, that that gentleman (Mr. Bourassa) is prepared to-day to endorse the assertion, that it is proper and desirable to maintain British supremacy in South Africa, and that the people in arms in that country against British authority should be called upon to submit to British control. This is all that can be required. This lays the foundation for the settlement of this question upon a basis which would be to the interest of all portions of this empire, and this motion deals simply with the character of the settlement that it is hoped may be obtained with the belligerents in South Africa, and obtained for the purpose of establishing in that country unquestioned and unimpaired British authority.
The motion, Sir, is au bumble expression of opinion on the part of this House. It may be asserted that it will be considered an act of impertinence to offer such a motion here.

While we have not a law which compels us to contribute a certain sum of money for imperial defence, yet we have done so voluntarily. Our soldiers have gone to South Africa ; our money has been expended ; we, as an integral portion of this great empire, hat e surely an interest in this question. I maintain that we in this parliament as the representatives of six millions of British subjects have a right to express humbly and respectfully an opinion, and that is all that the resolution asks shall be done.
Now, Sir, the motion may be useless, but the spirit manifested in offering it cannot 'be questioned and cannot be condemned. The motion may have no weight, but on the other hand it may perhaps be extremely useful. It may aid the imperial government in the settlement of this question by showing that in one of the great colonies of the empire the same spirit of bitterness does not exist that probably does exist in Cape Colony and Natal. This motion may have a counteracting influence possibly. to the pressure from the British colonists in these colonies asking for the exacting of vengeance upon the Cape rebels. If the motion does' produce that effect, it will have a beneficient Influence ; it may counteract that influence upon the British gov-

eminent which would be a most prejudicial and harmful one. In any event, while the motion is meant to do good ; while the motion is respectfully expressed ; while it is -merely an expression of opinion ; in any event if it does do no good, in mv opinion, it can do no harm. I shall no doubt be subjected to criticism for offering this motion, but that is a matter of utter indifference to me, provided I can feel that I have done right.
What troubles me is whether it is a judicious act, whether it is a proper act, whether it is something I ought to have done or ought not to have done. As to how it will be received by my fellow citizens is a matter of minor importance. It is my firm conviction that in the course I have taken I have been actuated by a sincere desire to benelit my country, to offer an influence that will aid in the settlement of a melancholy struggle. The motive, at all events, in offering this resolution is a good one. My own record with regard to this matter would render it absurd to say that I am actuated by pro-Boer . sentiments. The House will remember the position I took on this question, the defence I made of the action of the authorities here and of the policy of the imperial government in this war. The House remembers that I would never for one moment have entertained the idea of parting with one foot of South African territory, or of lowering the British standard in the slightest degree. I have always maintained that British supremacy must be maintained in South Africa. I take that position to-day, and the question with me now is, what is the best course to pursue in seeking such a settlement as will place matters in South Africa on a just, humane and enduring basis.
Now, Sir, nobody would venture to make the assertion that Canada is not loyal to the empire. The expression of this humble opinion, if the House chooses to sanction that expression, will not be accepted in England as an evidence of disloyalty. It will, on the contrary, be accepted in* England as an evidence of the sincere desire of Canada to aid, if it possibly may aid, in securing a settlement of a question which it is desirable to have settled. Canada is loyal to the empire, and its loyalty has been proved. Nobody in this country or in the world at large doubts that Canadian loyalty is something that will bear the strain, something that can be relied on, something that is thoroughly imbedded in the hearts of the people of this country.
Now, what were Canada's interests in this struggle ? Here we are on a continent, pos- I sessing more than two-fifths of it. with vast resources, with our own destiny to work out, with our own nationality to erect, with our interests requiring our utmost efforts for their advancement, with enough to command our utmost labours and resources. What had we to do as a matter of selfinterest with the struggle in South Africa ?

But we sent the men and voted the money because we wished to maintain and uphold the integrity of the British em-' pire; because we wished to maintain the prestige of England; because we wished to have that country which afforded us a market, that country with which we were allied by the bonds of race affinity and by political institutions, furnished with aid, not from any selfish consideration, but purely as an offering to the welfare of the empire, given freely and fully by one of her great colonies without hope of securing reward for the sacrifices made. Canada stands in the position to-day where, having made these sacrifices, having put forth these efforts, having proved by its conduct that it is thoroughly loyal, it naturally desires to see an end put to this struggle that lias been in progress for three years, and an honourable peace obtained; and Canada actuated by that desire may venture to express to the imperial authorities a humble and respectful opinion as to what course, in the estimation of the people of this country, might be pursued.
It is preposterous, Mr. Speaker, to assert that that expression of opinion can be or will be considered in England or anywhere else an impertinence. Of course, British authority must prevail; that is an absolute condition. No proposition of peace will admit of consideration involving Boer independence or anything but the absolute sovereignity of Great Britain over all South Africa-the Orange Free State, the Transvaal, Cape Colony, Natal, Rhodesia, and the whole of that magnificent country. British authority and sovereignty must prevail. This House perhaps lias not been fully aware of tiie importance of that country, that great region of 1,500.000 square miles now in the possession of Great Britain, with vast possibilities for the increase of territory, with resources almost beyond the dream of the enthusiast, awaiting to be developed. A few days ago Cecil Rhodes was buried on the Matoppa Hills with imposing ceremonies, and his grave overlooks that vast region which liis genius and his. energy secured for his native land-a region which embraces the ancient Ophir, a region of untold possibilities, a region which England never could have afforded to have lost and must have put forth great efforts to retain. Happy perhaps it would have been if the genius and the experience of Cecil Rhodes had exercised more influence upon the counsels of British commanders and British authorities in South Africa. But this conflict has nearly run its course. It has been a great struggle, a greater struggle than was

anticipated at the outset, a struggle which will form one of the epochs of history, a struggle which has demonstrated the resources, the credit, the perseverance, the indomitable grit of the British citizens. We perhaps fail to understand the obstacles which they have overcome. With a single line of communication from Cape Colony penetrating into the far north, 1,500 miles in length, liable to be cut at almost any point : with the transport over that overloaded line of the supplies for a large army; with an aggressive and acute foe, familiar with the country; the subjection of the Boer has been a great achievement. It has been, I repeat, a great struggle ; and Great Britain has learned in this war lessons with regard to the conditions of modern warfare that will be worth to her all the money she has expended.
And now we come to the point when this war is practically ended, when the opposition! that remains is merely guerilla warfare. We come to the point of considering what were the causes of this war, and what distinction shall we draw between the belligerents in one section of South Africa and those in another ? Shall we make a different rule of settlement for the Orange Free Stater, the Transvaal man and the Africander of Cape Colony ? Is the one a rebel whom we shall put into chains and hang, and the other an honourable belligerent whom we shall treat with and pardon, and deal with on the terms of civilized warfare.
Sir, the deep-seated case of the hostilities in South Africa was the determination on the part of the Dutch element in that entire country from Cape Town to the Transvaal, to make South Africa a! Dutch country. The Afrikander Bund, for years before the hostilities began, was laying its plans, accumulating its resources, buying arms and munitions of war, erecting fortifications and preparing for this struggle, which it entered upon deliberately. It had one clear purpose in view and that was to expel the British from South Africa, and when it found that Great Britain was transporting troops to that country, and threatening the success of that policy, it precipitated hostilities by invading British territory. I hold that every belligerent in South Africa should be dealt with on the same principle, that we should draw no distinction between the Dutehmeu of Cape Colony and the Boers of the Transvaal or the Dutchmen of the Orange Free State. They all belong to the one nationality. They were all actuated by the one purpose and fought in the one [DOT] common cause. We were contending, not with the Transvaal Dutch or the Free State Dutch alone, but with the Afrikander element in South Africa from Cape Town to the Zambesi.

Africa to erect a Dutch empire in that country. The Boer was a brave foe. He fought for his race, for his ideals. He staked his life upon the issue, and he has lost. It was known toy close observers from the outset that there could be but one of two results. Either the Afrikander must prevail or the British; either South Africa would be Dutch or British. One thing or the other had to come to pass. And the thing that has come to pass is that the Afrikander has been driven to the wall, that the British forces are supreme and the contest practically ended. The question now confronts the imperial authorities :	How shall this
war, which has degenerated into murder, rapine and foray, how shall these useless hostilities be terminated ? It is a question of delay in putting an end to useless suffering. It is a question of delay in the advent of prosperity' and peace in South Africa. How is peace to be secured ? How is this delay in securing peace to be obviated ? How are these useless struggles in South Africa to be terminated ? They can be terminated toy protracting this struggle until the Boer cause is ground into fine dust. But it will take long to do it, many lives will be lost, and when that result is reached there will be left the seeds of bitterness and hatred in every Boer heart south of the; Zambesi. It can be done in another way. It can be done by the exercise of mercy and magnanimity'. The exercise of these two qualities will hasten peace, and not only hasten peace, but place that peace, when it comes, upon a sure and certain foundation, and leave these people satisfied that the struggle is indeed ended, and that it is useless to perpetuate it longer. On the other hand, severity will retard peace and leave endless hate to fester in the heart of every Boer in that country.
The imperial authorities are facing today the question of African reconstruction. The conditions of things that existed before cannot be continued. There can toe no Transvaal with its dim shadow of suzerainty to the British Crown. There can be no independent Free Orange State. There can be no divided authority in South Africa. The whole country must be under one flag and one king. It must be a part of the one great empire. That is a foregone conclusion. How is this South African reconstruction to be accomplished ? Not by the exercise of vengeance, not by the exacting of the pound of flesh, not by pursuing a fallen and noble foe to the utmost extremity of vengeance. But African reconstruction will toe accomplished, if it is ever accomplished on an enduring basis, by Afrikander assimilation. Afrikander assimilation will be the hope of South Africa, and without ""it peace upon any enduring basis and success in the formation of a South African confederation cannot be secured. We have the exercise of a great principle now in operation which is peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon-the principle of federal

union, first adopted by tbe American states after the revolution, in 17S7, next adopted by Canada in 1807, since then adopted by Australia, and waiting now to be adopted by South Africa. In that country there will be the colony of Natal, the colony of Cape Colony, the colony of the Orange Free State, the colony of the Transvaal, the colony of Rhodesia and other colonies to the north in that magnificent valley of the Zambesi, beyond which British possessions reach to the great inland sea of Tanganyika. This African reconstruction will be accomplished. It will build up in South Africa an empire under British influence and British laws. It will be another of the great commonwealths formed under British influence, and in accord with the genius of British laws and institutions. Does any man doubt that magnanimity will promote this result, that the exercise of mercy and generosity will have a favourable influence on the population of these colonies and tend to cement in ties of common interest their institutions and their laws ? I think it cannot be doubted, and one reason why I introduce this resolution is the belief I entertain that the imperial government is probably embarrassed at this moment by the demands of the English colonists of Cape Colony and Natal, who refuse to consider the Dutch in arms against British authority in Cape Colony in any other light than rebels, and who demand the condign punishment of these men after the war is through. I do not believe that it would be good policy to adopt such a course. I do not believe that we should make any distinction between the Cape Town rebels and the Orange State belligerents and the Transvaal soldier. I believe, if any distinction is to be made, that it will simply retard the settlement and make it less satisfactory and less likely to be enduring after it is accomplished. This feeling, no doubt, impedes reconstruction. In my humble judgment, this feeling is an embarrassment to the imperial authorities, and for that reason I believe that the expression of a respectful and humble opinion on the part of the representatives of this great colony of the Dominion would have great weight with the British authorities and be most welcome. In this view I have ventured to offer this motion, and in so doing I believe that I am acting in the interest of my country and of humanity and on lines which would promote settlement in South Africa and hasten the realization of that condition of things for which we all hope. A great many thousand Boers are in captivity. Some are in Bermuda, some in St. Helena, some in Ceylon-thousands and thousands of these men who must be restored to their country some day-and it is a matter of the utmost consequence whether these men come back with sore hearts and cherishing vengeful feelings because of undue severity which they believe their conquerors have practiced, or whether they come back with gladness of heart, with
thankfulness for mercies granted to them, for magnanimity, for generosity, for the restoration of privileges, for the expression of a desire that they should go back to their native land and become good citizens and obedient to the country that had treated them with magnanimity which I believe it would be wise to display.
The Boer, Mr. Speaker, will make a magnificent component ethnic quantity in South Africa. His is a noble race, the race that held at bay Alva in the Netherlands, the race that furnished to England the Prince of Orange, the race that has the lofty faith of the puritan and the endurance of the puritan-that is a constituent portion of the population of South Africa that it is worth the while of the British authorities to cultivate. It is worth their while to make this Boer element a loyal element, to make of this Boer element an element attached to the English institutions, an element that realizes that it has been treated with generosity, with magnanimity, and that it can put its faith in the power with Which it is dealing. Now Britain wants in this matter, I apprehend, not revenge, that is not a British characteristic. Britain faces its foe, conquers its enemies and then deals with them generously. Britain wants no revenge ; but she wants a united people in South Africa, the restoration of prosperity to that country and the creation of a commonwealth there that, in its history and progress will redound to the glory of English institutions and of English government. England wants no revenge, no devastated farms, no ravaged lands, reduced to the condition of a desert; no hords of beggars and fugitives harrying the country ; she wants a prosperous land, a return to fixed conditions, and the gathering together of these people in their homes, and the use by them of their energies and industry to the advancement of the state. And, Sir, in gaining this aspiration, the three angels, mercy, amnesty and peace stand ready to give their services to securing the consummation of that which every true citizen of Canada must desire.
Now, it may be asked, Mr. Speaker, when the exercise of the qualities of mercy and magnanimity is urged, when the granting of amnesty is proposed, have we any parallel for this policy ? I answer :	Yes. And
every parallel we have is a shining, a glorious example of the success of this line of policy. In 1759, Canada passed from one authority to another. Prior to that, the scapling knife, the tomahawk and the torch worked their savage will along the frontier [DOT] from Penobscot to Fort Du Quesne. For generations the English colonists and the French colonists were engaged in bitter war, and the hatred of each side for the other was intense and consuming. We had the slaughter of Braddock's army at Monogahela : we had the battle of Ticonderoga and the British reverse there ; we had the war-whoop and the Indian foray ; we had bitter

and deadly hostilities along this whole border year after year. And when, at last, Wolfe took Quebec, and under the treaty of Paris, Canada was ceded to Great Britain. the policy that was pursued toward the' French people of this country was to allow them to retain their laws, their religion, their language, their social and ecclesiastical institutions. And this broad, comprehensive, liberal policy adopted with these sixty thousand Canadians in British North America has had results for which we cannot feel too thankful.

But does it follow that it is wrong to counsel that policy which the hon. gentleman assumes that England will pursue ? Is it wrong to express the humble opinion here that the policy he says England is likely to follow will receive our approbation ? I think not. As I said at the outset, the expression of this wish can do no harm if it is unnecessary, and it may do good. This historical example -to which I have referred resulted in firmly attaching all this race to British institutions. Thirteen years after the treaty of Paris the American revolution broke out, and an attempt was made by American agitators to carry the French colonists with them. But they failed. Those French colonists were faithful to British institutions then, they have been faithful to British institutions since, and they are faithful to British institutions now-and their history affords a shining and crowning example of the results following the policy of mercy and	magnanimity in ' treating with a conquered foe. We had another case in the thirteen colonies. There was a Dutch colony there, which was called the New Netherlands. That colony was conquered and re-cliristen-ed New York, and the Dutch colonists were incorporated with the Anglo-Saxon population. They were treated with generosity ; their rights and privileges were assured to them, including their language if they chose to use it. To-day it is one of the most loyal elements in the country. It lias given one president .to the union-Van Buren-it has its representative in the United States Senate Depew-and it has given rise io a great family of railway kings, the, ^ anderbilts. Its history affords an illustration of the desirability and propriety of treating nations thus incorporated into another with genei-osity. And we have a still more striking example in the United States itself, in, the great struggle of the civil war. That war. was carried through with relentless and remorseless energy. It was a titanic struggle. The north and the south were arrayed against each other on a question of principle, and the hostilities between the sections was of the bitterest kind. The battles fought in that war were remarkable for their sanguinary character. In all the great battles of Europe, the number of men killed was smaller in proportion to the number engaged than in the great battles of this terrible war. There was Chancellorsville with its seventeen thousand dead ; there was Vicksburgh; there was Chieamauga ; there was Missionary Ridge. They fought the fierce seven-days' battle in the wilderness. Great struggles. Great loss of life. The south planted thick with graves. The soil soaked with blood. The war was fought out to the bitter end with relentless hate and, animosity. And at last, at Appomatox, Lee surrendered to Grant. The southerners were' exhausted. They were treated with the greatest generosity. A union soldier would deprive himself of his breakfast to give food to the starving confederate. And when the southern army was disbanded, Grant said :	' Take the horses,
you will need them to put in your spring crops ; take anything that you can make use of-anything that will be of service to you as private property-I will take as public property only what you cannot use.' And these men disbanded with the kindest feelings toward their conquerors. And but for the unfortunate death of Lincoln, the reconstruction of the south would have been speedy and complete. There was a great cry for vengeance on the leader of the southerners, Jeff. Davis, but he was -never punished except by temporary imprisonment. There was no confiscation of the property of a rebel, there was no disfranchisement of a rebel, there was no vengeance inflicted upon the heads of rebels; but there was magnanimity, there was generosity exercised by the conquerors to the conquered ; and the result has been a reconstructed nation, and those two belligerent sections fighting under the same flag in the wars that have since occurred where their country has been engaged. So, Sir, this struggle in the United States, which passed beyond the limits of a rebellion and became one of the great wars of history, is but a type of the struggle that has occurred in South Africa. In South Africa where the principle at issue has been whether one race or another should possess the country, where the prize has been the possession of South Africa either for Boer or for Briton, as in the case of the United States, so in the case of South Africa, let the same generosity and magnanimity be exercised towards the foe now as was exercised towards the foe then.
Heretofore, Sir, the Dutch in South Africa have fgught against our progress. We have had no sympathy with the Burghers. If we can possibly attach to our interest that element of the African population : if we can make them loyal to British institutions ; if we can make use of their energy, and their courage, and their powers of endurance to forward the British cause in South Africa, why, the whole southern half of the conti-

neut lies at our feet It Is a question of great importance what our possessions in South Africa shall be. We have in the north, from Alexandria and Khartoum to Uganda and Victoria Nyanza, possessions reaching across 36 degrees of latitude and to the very heart of the continent. We have in South Africa possessions reaching from Cape Town away north to the Zambesi, and beyond the valley of that great river and the great inland sea of Tanganyika ; and we can make great additions to that empire-it is not necessary to state in what direction. It is of enormous importance to British institutions and British interests that the Boer element, the Dutch element in South Africa, should be consolidated and made a loyal element of the population of that country. And, Sir, we can afford to dispense with all desire to gratify feelings of revenge, we can afford to be generous and magnanimous, we can afford to say to these men : Lay down your arms, resume your allegiance, and you shall have, as fast as you can be safely entrusted with it, the franchise and every right of a British subject, and representation in the colonial bodies that will be erected here ; and we will establish a confederation in South Africa with provincial autonomy and a great central government as in Canada, attached to the government of Great Britain.
Now, Sir, the measure of blood is full, the measure of misery is full ; and I imagine that no man in Canada wants any more. We are warranted in looking for a day when South Africa, like Canada will be a great commonwealth with two races moving together hand in hand, as is the case here, in promoting the interests and extending the boundaries and increasing the power of that South African commonwealth. Sir, mercy, and magnanimity, and amnesty are the powers that need to be exercised to secure this result. In moving this motion, Hr. Speaker, I have been governed by a sincere desire to place a statement before the House, to urge reasons to this House, that would warrant us, as I believe, in expressing an humble opinion as to the propriety of inaugurating that policy which I have set forth, which I believe to be the touchstone for the settlement of our difficulties in South Africa upon a permanent, a desirable and an enduring basis.

I need not say that with all the views expressed by that hon. gentleman, as well as with some parts of the motion itself that he has placed in your hands, I do not fully agree. Professors of logic in this House will probably find a great deal of comfort and pleasure in such a declaration as this. But, Mr. Speaker. having no other aim in this matter but Mr. CHARLTON.
to fulfil what I believe to be my duty as a representative of the Canadian people, and my duty as a British citizen, whenever I find an opponent of mine coming towards my position I am willing to meet him half way. So far as British supremacy in South Africa is concerned, from the very beginning of this unfortunate war I stated clearly that I thought British supremacy was a necessity in South Africa. I admit that the warlike spirit which reigned in this House as well as in this country has perhaps made some hon gentlemen forget the position I took at that time. But the position I took then, the position I have taken all along, and the position I take now, is that the only way by which British supremacy can be established in South Africa is by adhering to the best British traditions of respect for minorities and of generosity to foes in war.
. to the right of this parliament to offer its opinion to the British government. I think there can be no doubt. I was astonished to hear hon. gentlemen opposite interrupt, with what I might call sneers, the assertion made by the hon. member for North Norfolk, that we have a right to express our opinion on this matter. It is strange that, along with the development of what is called the new imperialism, and along with so much profession of fraternity on the part of the upholders of the new policy, they are always ready to take the subservient position that they are willing to be taxed, they are willing to give the blood and the money of this country, but they dare not express a single opinion on the issue of a war towards the prolongation of which they have contributed.
From the start of this question, I held, of course, that it was not our business to interfere at all in Africa. But from the moment we did interfere, either wilfully or not-from the moment this parliament called upon the Canadian people to vote a cent towards the carrying on of this war- we acquired the right of saying what should be its result. Now, if the hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) would come in with a motion interfering with the position taken by the British government-that, of course would not hurt my feelings very much-but it might lead a majority of the members of this House to say that it would be a mistake for this parliament, at this moment, to propose anything that might embarrass the British government. But, Sir, we should not be more loyalist than the King of England, we should not be more attached to British institutions than the parliament and government of Great Britain. It is now a well known fact to the entire world that the British government and the British people are endeavouring to secure peace in South Africa and are just as anxious for it as are their opponents. We have not yet the text of the speech that was delivered a week ago last Monday by the Chancellor of the Exchequer ; but what

do we see in the reports sent through by the associated press ?
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach is seldom dramatic; but when he referred to-day to the government's intention to restock the Boer as well as the colonial farms, his voice rose to an eloquent pitch. His gesture, as he spoke in praise of the valor of the Boers and expressed his hopes for subsequent friendship between Britons and Boer, took the House with him, and the cheers, especially from the opposition, prevented the speaker from continuing his speech for several moments.
When the hon. member for North Norfolk, a moment ago, gave expression to almost similar feelings, there were also some interruptions, but interruptions indicating that the broad feeling of generosity which is passing now through the British parliament, which is animating the mass of the British people, has not yet, unfortunately, penetrated this House. Whatever may be our differences upon this question, whatever may still be our private opinions as to the merits of this war, as to the causes which have led to this war and to the way in which this question should have been treated in years past, I think we can afford to bury these differences. We should be ready to help the British government and the British people in putting an end to this cruel and unfortunate war.
It has been stated in the press, and may be it will be stated in this House, that by adopting this motion we are embarrassing the British government and helping the enemies of Great Britain, and thereby preventing the war to be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. But, Sir, what did Sir Michael Hicks-Beach say in the British parliament, in the name of the British government ?
After the war was over there would be (he great expenses of the relief and settlement of the two colonies and the re-stocking of the. farms. He hoped that when durable peace was' made, parliament would be generous and loan money for restocking the farms, not only of those who fought on the British side, but of those who had been honest enemies and whom they now hoped to make friends, and for railroad and other enterprises to serve to develop the two states.
So it is proper for the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Great Britain to say that the British people are ready to tax themselves and to borrow money in order to give the Boers back the farms, and restock them, after the British government had declared two months ago that they would seize these farms and sell them to pay for the support of the concentration camps. If the British government have come to the conclusion that they must change so radically their policy, is it not proper for the parliament of Canada to say simply and solely that a policy of mercy and generosity should be the basis upon which this war should be settled ? Not only are we not embarrassing 105
the government of Great Britain, but by passing this resolution we are helping the British government.
The hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) interrupted the hon. member for North Norfolk and asked : ' Is not the example given by Great Britain in 1763 a guarantee that the same policy of generosity will be adopted in this case ? ' Circumstances alter cases. In 1763 there were two great powers fighting upon this continent, turies, and hon. gentlemen in this House They had been fighting in Europe for cen-seem sometimes to forget that if England had conquered on the soil of America she had been conquered on the soil of Europe during the Seven Years' War; that the treaty of 1763 was a treaty of give and take between England and France ; and that some advantages which France secured on the continent of Europe were compensated for to England by the cession of Canada, securities being given that the rights of the French settlers should be respected. The hon. gentleman seemed to assume a condition which does not exist in this case ; but I put that altogether aside. Contrasting the tone of the present English with the tone of the Canadian press, I am quite ready to say that, if I were a Boer myself, I would rather submit my whole case to British public men than to some colonial public men. But, Sir, this fight is not merely a fight between Great Britain and the Boers. This fight is a fight between the Boers, the Cape Colonists, or rather those who are called Cape Loyalists, and the paramount power of Great Britain. That the British government and the British parliament are disposed to show generosity in their treatment of a conquered foe, I have not the slightest doubt; but, at the same time, that there are in Natal and Cape Colony a certain number of people who are ready to exact the pound of flesh, who are only looking to their own personal interests, and who would be ready to see the peace of the empire sacrificed if their personal interests were thereby secured and their personal feeling of revenge were assuaged, there is not the slightest doubt. You have only to read the statements which have been published in the British press to get evidence of this fact ; and the purpose of this resolution is neither to embarrass the British government nor to dictate terms to the British government, but it is to give strength to the British authorities in order that the very proposition that they are ready to uphold shall be upheld, and that they will be strengthened against the exactions of the very narrow loyalist element of Cape Colony. When I speak of the loyalist element of Cape Colony, I am not referring to the whole English speaking population of Cape Colony. There are, in South Africa, thousands of English-speaking people who have looked upon this war as a most unfortunate



period of British history, and of African history, and who would like to be helped so that this policy of generosity and mercy might be granted to the enemy.
It is true that the example of 1763 is to a certain extent a guarantee to us that the policy of generosity will be adopted. But there were other rebellions in other periods of the history of England which showed that some of the officials of Great Britain are not always animated by this sentiment of generosity. We have the history of the Jamaica rebellion where the British governor-after having notified the home authorities that the rebellion was over and that there was no more danger of uprising-caused hundreds of people to be hanged and flogged. I know that such is not the policy of the British government to-day; but we have unfortunate instances which show us that among the loyalist population of South Africa there is an element that would be glad to carry out, not the policy of the British government, not the policy of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, not the policy of Mr. John Morley, not the policy of the leading spirits of British opinion to-day; but the policy of Governor Eyre of Jamaica. X am sure that the British government will not give away to such pressure, but at the same time I believe that should their hands be fortified by expressions of 'opinion from the colonies generally, and especially from the Canadian parliament, it would be all the better to confirm them against temptation.
X agreed to second this motion in a spirit of conciliation. My opinions upon the merits of the war have not changed. My opinions as to the conduct of the British government previous to the war and during the war have not changed. These opinions were held by me sincerely and honestly, and I still hold them. But when I saw that a representative of the Englishspeaking majority in this House was ready to join hands with me in a motion like this, I was willing to put aside for the moment many of my opinions upon this question, and I did so in the hope that this House would receive the motion in the same spirit of conciliation, of peace, and of harmony.
One more word. I have my opinion and my strong opinion as to the policy of the British government upon this whole question-as to the policy especially of Mr. Chamberlain. But, I suppose lion, gentlemen opposite have a great deal of admiration and consideration for Mr. Chamberlain and his policy. For the past two years, previous to, during and after the last general election, what was the position taken by Mr. Chamberlain ? It was : That the policy of the British government was framed not only in accordance with the wishes of the British people, but it was framed in accordance with the wishes of the people of the whole empire. His strongest argument against his Liberal opponents was : That the entire opinion of the colon-

",Liberal,,Joseph Henri Napoléon Bourassa,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=2a8c7330-53c3-44dc-9f77-c16aa6af7898&Language=E&Section=ALL

That was repeated a hundred times by Mr. Chamberlain in parliament and out of parliament. We have therefore the very words of the Colonial Secretary, that he considers the opinion of the colonies as a great weight.
What is the opinion of the British government at the present time with reference to this matter ? XJp to within the past few weeks it was announced time and again by nearly every member of the government that unconditional surrender was the only basis upon which the war could be settled. But now we have the straight declaration of the government organs and supporters, and of members of the government themselves, that a policy of generosity and mercy is going to be the basis of the settlement. It may be said that when the Boers lay down their arms, then would be the time for this parliament to say that they should be treated leniently. But, if the British government, who know their position in Cape Colony-if the British authorities, both civil and military, who know exactly where they stand and where the enemy stands-if they should still persist in saying that unconditional surrender is the only basis upon which the war can be settled-I then would agree with the argument that this parliament should offer no suggestion until surrender is made by the enemy. But although hostilities are yet going on, we have the announcement that the British government will probably agree upon a policy of mercy and generosity; and that being the case, the passage of this resolution by the Canadian parliament would be a great help to the British government. It would not mean that we came between the British government and their enemy; it would not mean that we came between the British government and British public opinion; it would mean that having heard that the British government were ready to settle this question upon the basis of mercy and generosity, we, the representatives of a people who have given their money and their men to uphold British power, are now ready to help the British government in according mercy and generosity to the enemy. Let me say here-and I believe the Prime Minister will not contradict me upon this point-let me say that the French Canadians as a whole are' opposed to this war. They detested, and they still do detest this war; but at the same time they are ready to join with their English-speaking countrymen in saying that the policy which has secured amity and friendship in Canada is the only policy that can secure amity and friendship and peace and harmony in South Africa.
I claim that the French Canadians have a special right to have their voice heard upon this question. We stand here as living testimony that this policy of conciliation is

the only one which can secure the acceptation of British institutions by a foreign element. Sir, that acceptation by us was not made in one year; it was not made in fifty years. We had to fight against British governments and against British governors, and against British civil and military authorities to get the rights that we now enjoy. It was not always peace in our history. Our freedom was not always a free and generous gift from the British authorities. It was very often a matter of fight, and had it not been for several outside circumstances, at times perhaps we would have lost what we had gained. But on the whole, why are we satisfied with the conditions under which we live ? Why have we become year after year more loyal and devoted supporters of British institutions ? It is because we have found that British rule, in its general and higher spirit and manifestation, is a good rule ; British rule is a rule of peace; British rule is a rule of conciliation, of progress and of prosperity. I therefore say that this parliament, more than any other representative body in the British world, is specially entitled to express an opinion at this period of the war. I insist on the point that this will not be an interference with the policy of the British government, but that on the contrary it will strengthen their hands in showing mercy to their foe; it will strengthen them in carrying out that policy of generosity which all well-thinking British people wish them to carry out.

",Liberal,,Joseph Henri Napoléon Bourassa,http://www.parl.gc.ca/parlinfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=2a8c7330-53c3-44dc-9f77-c16aa6af7898&Language=E&Section=ALL
37603,ca.proc.d.1902-04-23.8.2.20,1902-04-23,intervention,,,,SUPPLY-SOUTH AFRICAN WAR-TERMS OF PEACE.,,,"For my part, I have no doubt whatever that both the mover and the seconder of this resolution are animated by the very best of motives. I have no doubt that both hon. gentlemen are thoroughly sincere in their hope that peace should be restored speedily in South Africa, upon the broadest possible basis of generosity to the Boers. On the whole, I do not regret this debate. At the same time, I must express the fervent wish that my hon. friend (Mr. Charlton) will not press his motion further, and that the debate shall stop here and now. My hon. friend from La-belle (Mr. Bourassa), who seconded the motion, told us that he took some exception to the speech of the hon. member (Mr. Charlton) who proposed the motion. We who know the views long entertained by my hon. friend (Mr. Bourassa) are not at all surprised at that.
He has stated at the same time that he takes exception to the motion which he has seconded. For this, I may say, I was not so easily prepared. But I will not quarrel with my hon. friend on this score. My hon. friend -has thought it advisable, and for this I do not blame him, to make a compromise with himself, to not carry out to the fullest extent the views he entertains on this matter. My hon. friend realizes that conciliation and compromise is an instrument 1051
of government, and that while it is quite proper and right for any one to hold his own convictions, it is also proper to remember that other people have convictions which they also hold dear. My hon. friend will realize that in a country like this, inhabited as it is by two different races, a policy of compromise and conciliation is indispensable if we want to make Canada a nation. This is the principle he wants to apply from Canada to South Africa, and in this I abundantly agree with him.
With the terms of the resolution, I may say without any hesitation whatever, I al-. together agree. The resolution advises that the war in South Africa should be settled on two principles. The first is the principle of British supremacy. I am glad to hear from my hon. friend from Labelle that he also agrees that the interests of South Africa and the interests of civilization at large require that South Africa should be under British supremacy. There are two races in South Africa, the British race and the Dutch race, equally proud, in many respects equally strong, so intermixed that it is impossible for either to have an absolutely homogeneous government. The Dutch and the British are there together-in the Cape, in Natal, in the Orange Free State, in the Transvaal, in Rhodesia. They are neighbours who meet together every day in the ordinary avocations of life. It is impossible to separate them. They must be governed by the same authority-which shall it be, Dutch or British ? This resolution affirms that this authority shall be British. With this we are all agreed. British civilization is the very civilization which will give what the Transvaal hitherto has not had-equality of rights for all, whether they be Dutch or British. That was the cause of the war-to secure this equality, which did not exist in the Transvaal. The Outlanders had long sought to obtain it, but failed to do so. The resolution affirms that the authority in South Africa shall be British ; and we know from past experience of British civilization everywhere, that if British supremacy reigns over South Africa, there shall be freedom, not only for the British, but for the Dutch as well.
The second principle affirmed in the resolution is, that there should be most generous treatment accorded by the victors to the vanquished, by the British to the Dutch. Sir, for my part I do not think any resolution is necessary to obtain this generous treatment for the Boers in South Africa. A brave foe always commands the respect of a brave opponent, and that is enough to show that the Dutch shall receive generous treatment at the hands of the British. Why, it was only a few days ago that on the banks of the Hart's river a position had been entrusted to a few men, most of them I am proud to say, Canadians. They were assaulted for the best part of a day by an enemy at

least eight times their superior in numbers. Each assault was repulsed, but after each assault the thin band of defenders were reduced in numbers. So reduced were they at last that there was not one man in that small force who had not been either killed or wounded. At last, when the position was carried, there was still a man defiant and proud-Bruce Carruthers was his name, a Canadian officer, I am proud to say- a name that is honoured in the heart of every one of his countrymen. By all the rules of war he might have been killed ; but *from the ranks of the enemy, in their sympathy, came the cry : ' Do not kill him ; in; is too brave a man ; he must live.' This, Sir, is the lesson of the war, and I have no doubt the victorious British now in South Africa will display the same spirit. I have no doubt they will say : ' The Dutch must live ; they have earned it by their gallantry in the field.' Sir, this is the position left to the men who are now engaged in South Africa, not only with war, but also with the negotiations for peace.
As to the right of this parliament to interfere in this question, to affirm this resolution, I, for my part, unhesitatingly say there can be no discussion whatever. The parliament of Canada to-day is a sovereign parliament. It is a sovereign parliament within the British empire. Many years ago the parliament of Canada asserted this authority, and claimed not only the privilege but the right to interfere in any question which might affect any part of the British empire of which we form a portion. It is now almost twenty years since the parliament of Canada passed a resolution in favour of granting home rule to Ireland. We were not directly concerned with the question ; but why did parliament twice in succession affirm the position that home rule should be granted to Ireland ? Because we felt that it was in the interest of Canada as well as of the empire that the wrongs of Ireland should be righted. It was only two years ago that parliament passed a resolution in favour of praying the British parliament to amend the Coronation oath. Why did we do so ? Because we considered that it was a question which affected the rights and priviledges and consciences of a large section of His Majesty's subjects. It was only three years ago that this parliament passed a resolution expressing its sympathy with the Outlanders in the Transvaal. We then affirmed that we sympathized with the efforts of the British government to right the wrongs which the Outlanders were suffering. Surely to-day we have the right to pass such a resolution as the one presented by my hon. friend from Norfolk and seconded by my hon. friend from Labelle, to ask that the rights of the Dutch population be generously considered.
But while I do not hesitate to say that we have the inherent right to pass such a reSir WILFRID LAURIER.
solution and to present our views as to the conditions of peace, I ask myself, and I ask my hon. friend from Norfolk and my hon. friend from Labelle, is it opportune, is it judicious, is it advisable to present such a motion to-day ? That is the question and I do not hesitate to say that in my opinion at this moment such a motion is very injudicious. I will go further, and I will say to my hon. friend from Labelle that if I felt as he does, that the passing of this resolution to-day would strengthen the hands of the British government to be merciful and to grant an amnesty, I would not hesitate to agree to it. But the question to-day is not in this position. On the contrary, in my humble judgment-and I think I can make it clear to any man in this House- if we were to interfere at this moment, we might hinder that peace which we all desire to see established. Sir, my hon. friend from Norfolk knows, and my hon. friend from Labelle, who has been a close student of all these events, knows that at this very moment negotiations are going on for a settlement of the terms of peace. My hon. friends know that only"" a few days ago Lord Kite he* ner and Lord Milner met the heroes of the war on the Boer side-General De Wet, a brave soldier, General Delarey, another brave soldier, General Botha, another brave soldier. They have been in close conference, and we have every reason to believe, though we are not yet informed officially, that terms of peace have been agreed upon.
We know that the Boer delegates have gone back to the commandos in the field to submit to them the terms upon which peace may toe secured. What these terms are we yet do not know, but is it advisable at this moment, when the conditions are submitted to the Boer commandos, that we should interfere and excite perhaps in them hopes which might clash with what has been done, and prevent the negotiations being brought to a peaceful and satisfactory conclusion ? My hon. friend from Norfolk may say perhaps that this is a remote contingency. My hon. friend from Labelle (Mr. Bourassa) may say that what we want is not to reach South Africa but England, but in these days of rapid communication, when news travels on wings, we were to pass such a resolution, its very terms would be wired at once to South Africa and possibly induce the Boers to break off the negotiations in order, if possible, to gain better terms. We are still in the dark as to the precise nature of the conclusions which have been reached but let me suppose a case, which is not a violent supposition. My hon. friend from Norfolk a moment ago referred to the civil war in the United States. Well, it is due to the American people to say that there never was more generous treatment accorded by a victorious foe to its enemy than was accorded by the men of the north to the vanquished south. There never was a page

333S
more glorious in the history of any natiori than (that which was written. But my hon. friend knows as well as I, perhaps better- because he also has been a close student of those times and events-that after the war, the amnesty granted was not given to all those who participated in the strife. It is to the eternal pride of the American nation that not a drop of blood was shed on the scaffold, that not a man was punished for his participation in the war, that even Jefferson Davis, after a few years of seclusion, was set at liberty again. But my hon. friend knows well that immediately after Appomattox, which he described to us so eloquently, the amnesty granted to Geueral Grant and later by Sherman did not cover all those who took part in (the war, but only those who had laid down their arms after the surrender. A number of civilians were then debarred from the enjoyment of civil rights, but gradually, as the peace of the country increased and dangers were removed, all the shackles and disabilities were struck off, and at last a universal amnesty was proclaimed. Suppose at this moment terms were agreed on between Lord Kitchener on the one side and the Boer generals on the other, and suppose those terms) did not include a general amnesty, but only an amnesty which covered the great mass of the belligerents, but excepted certain individuals. And suppose the resolution of my hon. friend were adopted and wired over to Africa, might not the Boers then say:	' Oh, we have the
Canadian parliament standing behind us, and we must insist on better terms.' I do not know that my hon. friend would then find that by his resolution he was promoting the cause of peace. I think we had better at this moment leave this question in the hands of the brave soldiers who are dealing with it-Lord Kitchener on the one side, and Generals Delarey and De Wet on the other. I think we had better leave them to determine the settlement, and I firmly believe in my heart that the terms which will be granted and accepted by these brave soldiers will be such as can be accepted by every British subject all over the world. When the terms of settlement have been agreed upon, when the country enjoys again the blessings of peace, should it be found that the terms were not as generous as, in the judgment of my hon. friend from North Norfolk and my hon. friend from Labelie, or perhaps my own, they ought to be, we shall not abdicate the right of the Canadian parliament to affirm and send its views to the imperial authorities. It will not be too late then, because that will be the time when we can speak effectively. But at this moment, when negotiations are pending, it seems to me the argument is overwhelming that perhaps we would lose all in attempting to save all. These are the views I have to submit to the House and to my hon. friend from North Norfolk, and if I have any wish which I can express to him, speaking, I believe, the sense of both sides of
the House, it would be that he ought not to press this motion, but agree to withdraw it.

MONK (Jacques Cartier).,,SUPPLY-SOUTH AFRICAN WAR-TERMS OF PEACE.,,,"I regret extremely, Mr. Speaker, that the unavoidable absence of the leader on this side of the House imposes upon me the task of offering a few remarks in respect to this resolution, but I must confess that what has fallen from the lips of my right hon. friend the First Minister has rendered much easier the task imposed upon me. It struck me from the very first that this resolution was extremely untimely-I might almost say out of place, to use no harsher expression. The circumstances are these. After a protracted and very bitter struggle, the two great enemies have entered upon negotiations in order to arrive at some basis of arrangement. I 'believe also that they have agreed upon terms, but what these terms are it is impossible to say. In fact the home government itself is probably at present not informed as to the details. It seems to me, therefore, that, under these circumstances-and I believe that in this respect I am fortunate in representing the opinions of my friends who sit around me to-day-regrettable, whatever may be our prerogatives-and I would be the first to revindicate the rights and privileges of parliament-that we should take any action which might interfere with the negotiations. Such interference might defeat the very object of this resolution, to which in reality very few, I am sure in this House, have any objection. It might imperil not only the beneficent work upon which the home government is at present engaged, but also the advantages which the Boers are anxious to secure.	t
The hon. gentleman who moved this resolution took up considerable time in explaining its opportuneness and purport, in which he was perfectly right, tout it seems to me that at this critical moment in this deplorable war, the voice of the politician-and in using that term, I am not implying anything which is not meritorious-should be silent, and we should leave the settlement completely in the hands of those armed foes who are now deliberating in order to secure if possible what we all desire-a satisfactory conclusion of this terrible conflict.
f believe that this parliament, with the sovereign rights which we undoubtedly have, can deliberate and express its opinion on every question. Yet I haVe been forced to the conclusion that, in a matter of this importance, in view of the constitutional principles which govern us, it would be better for our parliament, as it would be better for the British parliament, to observe the rule which I think they have steadily adhered to, and to which they have shown their adherence within the past few days-the rule that the conclusion of a treaty belongs to the executive authority. I Parliament, of course, as my right hon.

friend (Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier) observed a moment ago, has reserved the right to criticise the conditions of the treaty when that treaty is concluded. And that is a rule which we should adhere to under the present circumstance, particularly in view of the fact that we have not the information necessary to enable us to form an opinion. In listening to my hon. friend from Norfolk, in listening to the remarks so vehemently urged by my hon. friend from Labelle, I was struck with the thought that, at this very hour, when great and courageous men are deliberating in the field in South Africa upon the conditions of the cessation of hostilities, how pitiful, if these hon. gentlemen will allow me the expression, how commonplace must appear the remarks which we make here, and how deficient in any truth and correct comprehension of the necessary important details which must attend any settlement. We can well take example form the attitude of the mother of our parliaments, that great assembly upon which this is modeled. It is a significant fact that, at this moment, the parliament of Great Britain has not taken up the study of this question, but has abstained, as it seems to me it should abstain, from deliberating on the question which, in its present critical stage can only be settled upon the field of battle itself. And I have remarked with no small degree of admiration that the great public men of England, the foremost men of that great country, where the almost constant necessity exists for public utterance on public questions, have refrained studiously from offering any deliberate opinion upon this serious question, as they are obliged to offer opinions every day upon other questions which present themselves for deliberation and decision in that free country. At a moment like this, and holding this view of the situation, I would not for an instant take up the task of pointing out certain serious discrepancies which have struck me not only in the speech of my hon. friend from North Norfolk, but also and more particularly in the remarks offered by my young friend the talented member for Labelle. I will not do that. God forbid that, holding the opinion that this-discussion should, as soon as possible, drop, I should commit the indiscretion of entering upon the discussion of these discrepancies, which, under other circumstances, I should certainly deal with. I must say that, amongst many painful [DOT]circumstances which attend public life, it is very satisfactory to see that upon a matter of this gravity, I believe I may say that there is a quasi unanimity in' this House. I believe-and I may add this to the remarks made by the right hon. Prime Minister who preceded me-that not only could we do serious injury to the British cause, which lias been so courageously upheld by our own fellow-countrymen in South Africa, not only could we do serious injury to the cause of the Boers themselves, a cause which must arouse our sympathy, Mr. MONK.
if not to the extent indicated by my hon. friend from Labelle, certainly to that extent which is always won by courage and valour-but I do believe that, upon the occasion of the visit to England of the Prime Minister of this country to take part in the coronation, any resolution which we might adopt, any view which this parliament might authoritatively express would place serious obstacles in the way of the performance of the task, which is a noble one and in which we all take an interest, of representing this great Dominion at that imposing ceremony. I believe that any resolution that we might pass might embarass the right hon. gentleman himself. Whatever views we may hold upon the great public questions in our own country, I, for one, would be extremely sorry on a matter of this gravity to embarass the right hon. gentleman in a mission which I submit, in more than one sense, he performs on behalf of both sides of this House. Mr. Speaker, I do regret that my hon. friend from North Norfolk has seen fit to bring this motion to the notice of the House ; I do regret that my hon. friend from Labelle has taken part in supporting it. My young friend from Labelle, who has many qualities that I very much admire, has not the deep interest in this matter that some others have. Let me remind him of that day when the friends and adherents of Macduff brought to him the harrowing news of the death of his wife and children. His henchmen surrounded him, sought to inspire him with the legitimate desire of revenge for this awful outrage. ""When Malcolm urges revenge upon him, we all remember the answer of Macduff-' He has no children.' Sir, my thoughts and my feelings go out generously to those who have a greater interest, a nearer interest, perhaps, in this matter than I have myself. And I do believe, Mr. Speaker, that many a man far and near- aye, Sir, and many a woman, too-will silently experience a feeling of deep gratitude to those of us in this House who, remembering that others have so many dear relatives upon the field of battle in South Africa, adopt the suggestion which some of us have ventured to make, that at this moment the discussion of this subject should be dropped.

If I thought the mother country required advice, I would be one of the first to offer it. But it is because I do not share that opinion that I desire to protest against this principle and against this resolution. I

may say, in passing, that in my judgment the whole tenor of this resolution and of the speeches supporting it are an implied denial that the instincts of the British nation are humane and generous, and that they are disposed to do what is right. If we believe conscientiously and implicitly that the instincts of the British nation are to do what is right, what is generous and humane, where is there any necessity for such a resolution '! 1 oppose it also because I think it is ill-timed. It is ill-timed to start a discussion in this House at the very moment, as lion, gentlemen have admitted, when negotiations are going on, negotiations that we sincerely hope and believe will bring about a peace to the satisfaction of all. I believe the resolution is unnecessary because England has ever been generous, as all her history shows, to conquered foes. It is an instinct of the Anglo-Saxon race, and that instinct has been in evidence in all the history of the British power the world over. England has been most liberal, most humane, most generous, in her treatment of those who have been conquered by her. But we cannot but remember how necessary it is that peace should be established on a firm basis in South Africa; because thrice already England has had trouble with her South African colonies, and it is absolutely necessary that peace should be established upon a firm basis in order that the rights of every British subject may be secured beyond peradven-ture in that country. For this reason, if for no other, I say it is unnecessary that we should interfere by resolution at the present time. It is because I think this resolution is improper, uncalled for, and is an unwarranted interference with the prerogatives of the British government, that I oppose it. 1 do not think that we are warranted by our past services in passing a resolution in the Canadian parliament giving advice to the imperial government, notwithstanding our liberality and our endeavour to sustain British authority in that far distant country. It is also because I believe this resolution is in very bad taste that I offer objection to it. To justify it upon the ground of what we have done, I think is in bad taste. What we have done we have done believing it to be right, believing it to be our duty; therefore, I do not think we are justified in invoking our past services as a plea for passing this resolution. I think the resolution is indiscreet. Once before when we offered advice with regard to the internal affairs of the British empire, we are reminded that the Queen would have regard to the advice of her constitutional advisers, or in other words, that she did not think it proper that the Canadian parliament should offer advice to the mother country regarding affairs which concerned her and not ourselves. Now I am far from saying that we have no right to tender advice; I believe, with those who have already spoken, that we
have such a right; but I do not regard it as the part of wisdom at this time that we should offer any advice. We are here to legislate for Canada and not for the purpose of settling South African affairs. Believing that we should attend to our own business, and believing as I do that we are drifting into an unsound custom of tendering advice to the imperial parliament on the most trivial occasions, I hold the views I have expressed, and I believe that this motion should be withdrawn.

MONET (Laprairie and Napier-ville).,,SUPPLY-SOUTH AFRICAN WAR-TERMS OF PEACE.,,,"Mr. Speaker, I wish for a few moments to refer to some of the remarks made by the hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule). That hon. gentleman admitted the unquestionable right of this parliament to express its opinion on every important issue with which the motion now before us deals, but he claimed that the resolution was untimely. And in that contention he followed the right hon. the leader of the House, and his own lieutenant-leader, the hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk). This contention being the very contention- of the hon. leader of this House and his own lieutenant-leader, the hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk),
I hope the hon. member for East Grey will not charge me with any lack of courtesy if, Instead of replying to every item of his speech, 1 merely refer him to the criticism which I intend to make on the speech of the leader of the Conservative party in the province of Quebec.
The hon. member for Jacques Cartier opened his remarks by saying that he regretted very much the absence of his leader from the House to-day, because owing to that absence it became his duty to voice the feeling of the opposition on the subject that was being discussed in this House. I believe the hon. member for Jacques Cartier was right when he regretted the absence of his leader. I believe it would have been far better for the hon. member for Jacques Cartier if his leader had been here, and had himself taken the responsibility of the attitude that has been taken by the hon. member for Jacques Cartier. What is the conclusion to be drawn from the speech of the hon. member for Jacques Cartier ? It is this : that the lieutenant leader of the Conservative party, the leader of the Conserva-

I do not believe that this attitude of the lieutenant-leader of the Conservative party will ever be highly appreciated by the Conservative party in that province.
Then the hon. member for Jacques Cartier, while not explicitly finding fault with the hon. member for Labelle for joining hands with the hon. member for North Norfolk, referred to the fact with a certain ironical smile covering his lips ; and it was very easy to see that he was amused at such a spectacle being given in this House. But if the hon. member for North Norfolk has been converted to the ideas that have been expressed by the hon. member for Labelle on the question of the South African war, he is'not the only member of tnis House who has been.
The hon. member for Jacques Cartier himself, in his capacity of lieutenant-leader of the Conservative party, is a convert to the views of the hon. member for Labelle. In the by-election that took place since the last session of this parliament in the county of Laval-and I see the hon. member for Laval (Mr. Leonard) sitting close to the hon. member for Jacques Cartier, and I challenge him to deny the assertion I am going to make- is it not a fact that the hon. member for Jacques Cartier in his capacity of leader of the Conservative party in the province of Quebec, said that he blamed this government for allowing England to recruit soldiers in this country to go to the front in South Africa ? This is the very attitude that was taken by the hon. member for Jacques Cartier in the by-election in Laval, and I ask him and I ask the hon. member for Laval to tell me if the hon. member for Labelle has ever gone further in that direction ? The hon. member for Jacques Cartier took the very same attitude in the byelection that took place in St. James Division. Montreal, where Mr. Bergeron, an exleader of the Conservative party, was candidate. He said there that he would have supported the motion brought before this House by the hon. member for Labelle if that motion had not been an academic motion, because, so far as the ideas were concerned, he sympathized entirely with the views expressed by the hon. member for Labelle. So, if the hon. member for Jacques Cartier saw fit to sneer a little about the hon. member for Labelle joining hands with the hon. member for North Norfolk, I think every member of this House can accord the same sneering to himself, because he has done the same thing as the hon. member for North Norfolk ; and why did he do so ? I am very far from blaming the hon. mem-

ber for Jacques Cartier for having done what he has done. I believe he has done so knowing that he voiced the feeling of the province of Quebec when he turned in the opposite direction from that which he had always followed on the South African question since he first occupied a seat in this House. Now, it is true that the hon. member for North Norfolk has changed a little his opinions about the South African war. or rather about the quality of the Boers peopling the Transvaal and the Orange Republic. I remember very well, when this question of the South African war was first brought up before the House, the hon. member for North Norfolk gave us one of the best reasons that could be adduced in favour of England waging that war, that England had the undoubted right to force British Institutions on these very same ignorant and half-barbarian people of the Transvaal. To-day I am glad to see that the hon. member for North Norfolk-and I congratulate him on the fact-considers that this ''brave race of the Transvaal deserves better treatment than he himself formerly thought should be accorded to them.
The hon. member for Jacques Cartier, in discussing the resolution which we are now debating, admitted that this parliament had the right to express its opinion on the question at issue ; but he said that the resolution was extremely untimely. Mr. Speaker, did the hon. member for Jacques Cartier, or did even the hon. leader of the government, give a single reason why this resolution is untimely ? It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that this resolution is very timely. In what circumstances is it brought before this House ? We know perfectly well that just now the question in England is, what treatment are we going to give to the Boers ? We know perfectly well that the decision is not arrived at yet. We do not know very well on what basis the peace will be made. Then, I say, if this parliament has a right ever to give its opinion on the terms of the peace which is going to be made, now is the time for giving that opinion. Those who claim that this resolution is untimely would do well to state when it will be timely for us to offer it. When will it be timely for us to ask the British parliament to give such treatment to the Boers of the Transvaal and the Republic of Orange ?

Then he does not share the opinion of his leader, the hon. member for Jacques Cartier, who said very plainly that he agreed with the very terms of the resolution. When will it be timely for us to express our opinion in the matter ? Will it be after the peace is concluded ? I say it will then be untimely for us to say anything about it, because the decision then will have been arrived at and there will be no use In our saying anything about it. The attitude of
the right hon. leader of the government and the hon. leader of the opposition (Mr. Monk) reminds me of that taken by a lawyer who, though he appeared to plead a case before the judge, would not speak. And when the judge said to him : Well, give me your opinion before I decide the case, the iawyer would reply :	No, it is not time
now for me to plead the case, but when the judgment is rendered I will give my opinion. It seems to me that if we accept the view of those who claim that this is not the proper time for us to express our opinion, that time will never come. If we are to express an opinion at all, there can be no doubt that to-day is the proper time to do so. No valid reasons have been given why this resolution should be declared untimely, but on the contrary very good reasons can be given why it is now very opportune indeed.
Let us look back to what took place before the war broke out. A few months before war was declared, at a time when there were only rumours of war, the right hon. the leader of the government rose in his place in this House on the 31st July, and taking advantage of the silent consent of the whole House, proposed a resolution without having previously given notice. The first part of his resolution read as follows :
Resolved, that this House has viewed with regret the complications which have arisen in the Transvaal Republic, of which Her Majesty is suzerain, from the refusal to accord to Her Majesty's subjects now settled in that region any adequate participation in its government.
Then the resolution concluded :
That this House, representing a people which
has largely succeeded

	.
Mind you, Sir, the very circumstance mentioned in support of the resolution I am quoting presents itself again to our consideration.
-which has largely succeeded, by the adoption of the principle of conceding equal political rights to every portion of the population, in harmonizing estrangements and in producing general content with the existing system of government, desires to express its sympathy with the efforts of Her Majesty's Imperial authority to obtain for the subjects of Her Majesty who have taken up their abode in Ihe Transvaal such measures of justice and political recognition as may be found necessary to secure them in the full possession of equal rights and liberties.
On the 31st July, 1S99, we considered it advisable for this House to pass a resolution assuring the British parliament that we sympathized with them in their efforts to secure to the Uitlauders of the Transvaal, who were still termed British subjects

Mr. MONET-the rights to which they were entitled. My hon. friend behind me says ' hear, hear,' and no doubt we may be told that in this resolution we were simply

expressing our sympathy with the British parliament in their endeavour to give equal rights to British subjects, whereas to-day we are asking that same parliament to grant a certain measure of magnanimity to the Boers. But I would remind hon. gentlemen that since the proclamation of Lord Roberts, the Boers have become British subjects at an English point of view, and when we are asking the British parliament to give the Boers the best terms possible, we only asking in their favour the equal rights which in our former resolution we asked for the Uitlanders. If, therefore, a few months before war was declared, it was right to take the step we did, why have we not the right to-day, before peace is concluded, to say on what basis we would like to see peace effected between England and the Transvaal ?
I do not suppose that much more can be said on this question. It seems to me that it has always been recognized in this House that the Canadian parliament has the right to make any representations to the British parliament concerning any matter in which we are but indirectly interested. We have done this several times in favour of home rule, and to those who object to this resolution because it is untimely and because we may rely on the magnanimity of the English people, I would say : Could not the same objection have been urged against those who asked this House to pass resolutions in favour of home rule ? Could we not then have been told that we might rely on the magnanimity of the British people and the British parliament in their dealings with the Irish people ?
The right we have to express our opinion is one that no hon. member in this House can dispute, especially in such a case as this, owing to the contribution which Canada has been called on to make in favour of England-a contribution which has been pretty heavy for Canada. That certainly gives us an undoubted right, apart from every other consideration, to send across to the home government the prayer embodied in the resolution before the House. Of course, owing to the fact that the mover of the resolution has withdrawn it, no practical result can ensue from this debate, but I believe it my duty to record my opinions on the matter, and if the hon. gentleman would press his resolution to a division, I would vote in its favour.

HUGHES (North Victoria).,,SUPPLY-SOUTH AFRICAN WAR-TERMS OF PEACE.,,,"It has been my misfortune, Mr. Speaker, not to have been present to hear the excellent addresses made by the mover of the motion (Mr. Charlton) and by my good friend the right hon. leader of the government as well as the other speeches made on this occasion. However, the motion is here and it speaks for itself. The introductory paragraph speaks of ' maintaining and firmly establishing '-I should imagine that our worthy friend (Mr. Charlton) would have trans-Mr. MONET
posed these terms and have first spoken of establishing and then of maintaining British supremacy in South Africa. The resolution reads :
This House is of opinion that British supremacy should be maintained and firmly established. in South Africa.
At present British supremacy is not firmly established there, and it has to be firmly established first, and then maintained irrespective of what the consequences may be.
The second part of the resolution I entirely dissent from :
And that in the interest of peace and of future tranquillity, harmony and homogeneity, it is expedient to offer universal amnesty as a condition of peace and submission to British, control, to all persons in arms against British authority in Cape Colony, Natal, the Orange River Colony, the Transvaal, and all other portions of the British dominions in South Africa.
From that view I entirely dissent. There is a statement-I have forgotten exactly where it is to be found-to the effect that the road to the nether regions is paved with good intentions. I am not impugning the motives of my good friend, the mover of this resolution, the hon. member for Norfolk, but there can be no doubt that it has been maudlin sentiment such as this that has prevented this war being closed long before now. We have had the pro-Boer in Britain sympathizing with the Boers. On any and every occasion, when disaster befell the British arms, no word of sympathy was heard from these gentlemen. But let the slightest victory be obtained by the Boers and they were jubilant ; let any treatment be meted out to these people in the way of forcing them to move from their farms and go into concentration camps and this maudlin sentiment-I use the word advisedly-has been shown by the pro-Boers, and not only the pro-Boers hut by a large class of sentimental people. This it is that has given encouragement to the Boers that some European complication might arise, that some nation might intervene before the close of the war to engage Britain's attention elsewhere, and then they would be guaranteed their independence. To my mind there has been but one course open to Great Britain from the outset. As was said by the right hon. leader of the House, In language that,
I believe, no tongue in this Dominion could match for beauty, the Boers themselves chose the arbitrament of war and they must be content to abide the consequences. There can be no conclusion to this war except that Britain shall force it to a finish, and that would mean the entire subjugation of that people. When they are subjugated, that is the time to extend the right hand of fellowship, that is the time for Great Britain to treat them as she has done the people in all her other colonies and give them

every opportunity to become true British citizens. Our good friend tile member for North Norfolk must have had some object in bringing forward this motion. I cannot say what it has been however. If his object was to bring about peace, I can assure him that if his tone could have beeu heard in the Boer camps it would have given those people great encouragement and would have tended to the prolongation of the war. His object certainly could not have been to promote the well-being of the Boers, because that would imply that Great Britain in the past has not accorded good treatment to the people she has conquered. But I think the pages of history will be searched in vain for evidence in support of any such contention. Britain has never treated any people whom she has conquered otherwise than in the most merciful and magnanimous spirit. But there is danger in being magnanimous and great with a people you have not conquered. Even after you have conquered them there is danger of their misunderstanding your magnanimity and greatness and mistaking it for weakness. Again and again have the kindness and generosity of heart of Lord Roberts and other British commanders in the field been laughed at by the Boers, their magnanimity sneered at as weakness and they themselves held in scorn. There is only one way to manage a man if he is your opponent-conquer him and then treat him kindly. So, with the Boers, there is only one way-conquer them first, and then let magnanimity and greatness and mercy follow. Some are inclined to say that there is a desire on the part of our good friend to advertise himself. I would not endorse that for an instant, because our good friend has been well known in the history of this House and the country as undertaking to lead in all this class of sentimental subjects, which really amount to nothing so far as benefiting the people is concerned. And the trouble is, when it is all over, from his own professions we are never really sure where to find him. There are people who are unkind enough to say that this is a put up job between the hon. member for North Norfolk and the right lion, leader of the government. I do not believe that for an instant. I am satisfied that that is not so. It may have been that the right hon. leader of the government may have been consulted before this motion was brought to the attention of the House. He should have been consulted. But, if he gave our worthy friend the answer then that lie gave him to-day, that he could not endorse his motion, that it was inopportune, or had told him that he wished him to withdraw it, would not a loyal follower, sucli as the member for North Norfolk has been of the lenders of his party through ail their devious turnings and twistings for twenty years or so- would not he have been only too willing to withdraw it instead of taking up the time of the House and placing it before the country ? I am satisfied he would. I do not object to the motion because it is ill-timed or inopportune, or anything of that kind. I oppose it on principle and I will give my reason.-
I deal first with the Free Staters, and Transvaalers. I do not find that the hon. gentleman mentions these but speaks of ' persons in arms.' But, so far as concerned those who were Free Staters and Transvaalers before the war, I will join hands with him. More than that, I stand here to say [DOT] that if these people had been properly used they would have laid down their arms nearly two years ago. It is a well known fact that General DeWet offered to lay down his arms and those of 18,000 followers. When the Free State was annexed by that beautifully-worded proclamation, got out by some of these artistic young ink-slingers-I was not in the party, I want the House to understand-annexing the Free State the condition was promulgated that those who would lay down their arms would be allowed to return to their farms and enjoy their civil rights. That was all right, but it was^ in another, a negative clause that the difficulty lay-that those who did not lay down their arms would be treated, when captured, not as prisoners of war, but as rebels. That clause could not have reached half the Free Staters in the field, but I maintain that every self-respecting Britisher must have found it objectionable. DeWet withdrew his army to the mountains away on the eastern side of the Free State and gave General Roberts an almost uninterrupted march to Pretoria. It is well known that a bitter feeling existed between the Free Staters and the Transvaalers. The Transvaalers deserted their capital, refusing to defend it. As soon as that news reached DeWet, he sent word to the British General-General Bundle. I think it was-that he was ready to lay down his arms, and gave as his reason that, inasmuch as the Transvaalers had failed to_ defend their capital he felt, as a Free Stater, that, in the interest of the two races and in the interests of the great future of South Africa the war should come to a close. He asked as a condition, a condition which I believe they will grant to-day, a condition which should have been granted then by any magnanimous general, that in place of being treated as a rebel, he and his kin of Free State birth and nationality should be treated as prisoners of war. It was denied him by the highest military authorities, I believe, in South Africa; and as if to drive him to surrender, his property was destroyed and his vineyards and his home were wasted. General DeWet is reported to have registered an oath that he would make the British pay in blood and treasure for that piece of work, and I kind of reckon he has carried out his threat. To-day I believe the same terms that General DeWet 1 demanded then are being accorded to these

men, the Free Staters and Transvaalers, and I say, rightly so, for they are Free Staters and Transvaalers. I never questioned their right to fight against us and bowl us over on any and every occasion, but 1 questioned their right to deprive us of the rights of British subjects in their republics.
But there is another question that my hon. friend from North Norfolk laid stress upon, that is the colonial rebels. Now, my worthy friend has read history, as every intelligent member of; this House has. Many revolutions have been justifiable. No man to-day, and no man at that time, ever questioned the right to rebel of Hampden and Cromwell. No lover of responsible government has ever questioned the righteousness of the rebellion of 1688 ; no man I ever met in modern times questions the righteousness of the American war of independence from the colonial view point. It has established throughout the world the principle that taxation carries with it the right of representation. When tyrants and oligarchs undertake to govern and tax people without giving them the, right of representation, then they expose' themselves to rebellion. In the American civil war the people of the south had, as they thought, a justification for rebellion in the defence of their old established principle of slavery. But it was a principle not consonant with the great principles of British and American liberty, and therefore it was deemed in the eyes of the world as an unrighteous cause, though others undoubtedly deemed it a righteous one. But I ask the hon. member for North Simcoe can he

He has not done it, and the man does not stand in this House who can do it. Who can give any more reason why any Boer in South Africa, any British Boer in South Africa, should rebel than why any man in the city of Ottawa should step out and rob a bank or murder his neighbour 7 He can't do it. The mere fact that they are cf the same race and lineage is no reason. Thousands of loyal Boers have fought for Britain against their own kinsfolk. The records of history show that great movements have never necessarily brought men of the same race together. Let us go back to the days when the ancestors of these men were fighting for the liberties of Europe, when the old Batavians, or as we know them in later times, the Dutchmen of Eur-Mr. HUGHES (Victoria).
ope, who were fighting for liberty against the tyranny of Spain and Austria. Were they lighting as men of one race ? Not at all. It was people of one race fighting against the tyrants of the same race, only they were allied with the free men of all nationalities. In France, the country of those gallant fellows, the Huguenots, whose descendants we find distinguishing themselves in South Africa to-day, when these men were struggling for liberty in the days of Coligny and Colbert, and that grand hero whose statue stands prominently in the old citadel at Quebec, Samuel De Champlain- when those men were struggling for liberty in Europe, who was it that fought side by side with them 7 Why, Sir, the free men of Britain, and in every struggle that Huguenots and Dutchmen engaged in all through history they have fought shoulder to shoulder with the free men of Britain. And, Sir, had they been fighting in a just cause in Africa to-day, mark my words, they would have had the free men of Britain standing shoulder to shoulder with them again. There were also in that cause thousands of loyal Boers fighting for Britain.
Now what are the conditions ? The Boer people had been repeatedly saved by Britain from the attacks of the natives, they had been placed on their farms by Britain, they had been given their liberty by Britain, they had been protected. There was not a solitary farm that was not regularly visited by the Cape mounted policemen, and law and order were everywhere dominant. They were free from taxation, they were free from excise duties in South Africa. Neither directly nor indirectly have I ever heard any man pretend to say that the British Boers in South Africa had any cause of complaint, and I never met one of them that pretended to have any. Their only excuse was the race cry. Now, Sir, there has been a little too much of this race cry, not only in South Africa, but in Canada. We don't want these appeals to race and religion in this country. We want men to stand out in South Africa, and in Canada, on the basis of principle, and to leave race and religious cries out of the question entirely. Their only excuse in South Afx-ica was the race cry. When you come to analyse their plea, they say they were promised by the Kruger and Steyn oligarchy exemption from debt, they were promised the farms of the British loyalists, and the Boer loyalists too ; they were promised shares in the Rand and in the other great mining corporations in South Africa. These were the excuses they offered, and the excuses that are offered to-day by the Boer rebels, by the British colonials who rebelled in South Africa. These are the only excuses they make; and yet my hon. friend from North Simcoe-North Norfolk-coolly stands up in the House and asks for aii amnesty for this type of men. Now, I want to point out to him that these Boer rebels

in South Africa have lost little or nothing.
I could name scores of them who took the poor whites, labouring men and their families on their large estates, and forced them to go on much against their will and fight against Britain. But whenever things got dangerous they-the leaders-withdrew to their own farms, and as soon as the British came along they would then hob-nob with the British and become advisers, or interpreters, or counsellors, in order to escape the penalty due them for their disloyalty.
I will give you one instance, a very wealthy man named Puplessis. who comes from the bank of the Vaal river, at Middle Drift, near Kimberley. He brought a number of those poor Boers to work for him on a Sat-urdav. and his excuse was that he wanted them to build kraals for the cattle and sheep and goats. These poor whites came over with their utensils and implements in order to build these kraals. On Monday morning Duplessis, who was a field cornet of the Boers, commandeered every man of them and made them go to the front to fight. A number of these fellows were killed, and others were taken prisoners. There was one of them, whose name was Van Vuren, and the incident in connection with whom I know very well. He was taken prisoner, tried for being a rebel and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in South Africa for the offence of taking up arms against the British government, while the man who brought him over under false pretenses, commandeered him and compelled him to fight, because he is rich and stands in with the British officers, was let off with five year's disfranchisement. The prime mover of the whole district is disfranchised for five years, while the poor beggars who were commandeered are either buried under the sod, or breaking stones for a period of years in South Africa. This is one of the gentlemen that our hon. friend wishes to let off. The leading rebels have lost nothing. Their stock was unmolested by the Boer forces. It was always the loyalists' stock that was raided, and I say it would have paid the British loyalist in South Africa hands down ten times over, from a dollars and cents point of view, to have joined the Boer forces in South Africa at the beginning of this war. The Boer rebels in South Africa are treated better than the colonial loyalists in South Africa. The loyalists-both British and Boer-were driven from their homes. They ,had to escape as best they could, they had to leave their property at the mercy of these people, their women and children were left on the farms at the mercy of these Boers. X am very glad to say ' that in the great majority of cases the treatment accorded them was fair, but it was imprisonment all the same. They dared not communicate with their friends, they dared not touch one of their own animals, and they were practically prisoners on their farms. Their property was taken, yet the claims of the loyalists have been actually denied while their Boer neighbours who were disloyal have been paid pound for pound for all that was taken from them by the Boers in the course of the war. There is one case which I think is the most scandalous on record. Before one of these compensation courts a gentleman and his wife were proving their claim, but the British officer refused to allow their claim on the ground that the wife should have stayed on the farm-the wife, a young English lady, about 23 or 24 years of age, with an infant baby- and should have protected the farm against the Boers, and cared for the animals upon it. She inquired where was the strong right arm of Britain upon which British rights had depended. She depended upon the British soldier to protect her, and when he failed her, she was expected to have guarded the stock against the Boers. Her husband and all her relatives were fighting for Britain, and she was forced to leave the farm as a refugee. That is the treatment which was accorded British loyalists in South Africa. When I speak of British loyalists, I mean loyalists of British stock as well as of Boer stock, because I am proud to say that there are tens of thousands of Boers out there who from the start to the finish have been thoroughly loyal to Britain in this affair.
There is another class besides the colonial rebel, that, I maintain, should be excluded from any such resolution as this, and it is the hired mercenary, the soldier of fortune, the adventurer who joined the Boer ranks to fight against Britain. He certainly should be excluded from any such resolution as the one proposed by the hon. member for North Norfolk. If this resolution were to carry, or if this principle were to be adopted, it would put a premium on revolution, and that sort of thing will not do. If men have a just cause for rebelling, why, then, by all means, let us be civil to them when the war is over, but until the hon. gentleman can point out one solitary case of complaint on the part of the colonial rebel against the British government, then, I maintain, he has no excuse whatever for bringing any' such resolution before the House. It must be made a risky job for these gentlemen to turn out and murder a neighbour, destroy his property and rob him of his stock. The hon. gentleman who has preceded me spoke of the settlement when this war is over. There can only be one settlement for the British government, and I trust it will be a settlement along British lines. We will give them the rights and liberties of Britain, the rights and liberties that have made Britain great, we will give them her language, her literature and her history. If those institutions which have made Britain great, which have made her the envy of the nations, are not sufficient for the people of South Africa, then let the war continue to a finish, or until we bring these people to their senses. I would treat them fairly. The Free Staters and Trans-vaalers who lay down their arms should be

treated in a fair spirit, and I never would ask them to surrender as rebels, but with the colonial rebels I have no sympathy whatever, nor has any man who is at all cognizant of the facts of the case. I maintain that this is a mere piece of maudlin sentiment, and at all times in the world's history it has done more harm than good to bring any such opinions as these before any country on an occasion of this kind. It is time enough to be magnanimous and great when the people you are dealing with prove themselves Magnanimous and great, prove that they regret the course they have pursued, and that they are ready to give an absolute guarantee that on the first occasion which presents itself in the near future they will not rise and seek to destroy that flag that I saw floating from the top of this tower to-day. As I came in on the train to-day I saw that grand old flag torn almost to tatters, and I wondered what was going on in the House. When I reached here and found that the hon. member for North Norfolk had been holding forth upon the notion of granting amnesty to the rebels of South Africa, who had arisen ana murdered their neighbours, destroyed their property and robbed them of their goods, and who had turned the women and children into camps up and down the country-not the concentration camps that hon. gentlemen talk so much about-I could not but feel that the breeze blowing at the top of the tower had found possibly a fitting semblauce iu the wind that was blowing in the House of Commons.

If plain every day Canadians are good enough to give their lives to the empire, I suppose plain every day members of parliament are good enough to give their views in support of the prestige of the empire, or to pull down that prestige if it so pleases them. I consider it is perfectly legitimate for this parliament to discuss the question of the war in South Africa, but not altogether because of Canada's contribution in men and money. Canada has reason to be proud of her contributions in men, but I am not so sure about her reason to be proud of her contribution in money.

Let that be as it may, I would not feel that I was doing my duty if I allowed a motion against whch I feel so strongly to be lad before this House, and to Mr. HUGHES ^Victoria).
I
let it go by giving only a silent vote against it. I look upon the prestige of the British empire as a question of the most intimate local character, concerning every dependency and every citizen in every dependency throughout the empire. The maintenance of the prestige of Great Britain is just as necessary to the peace and welfare of Canada as it is to the peace and welfare to the county of York in England. So long as Canada is a part of the empire, the safety of Canada depends upon the strength of the empire. Anything that weakens the empire weakens Canada, endangers Canada, and hurts every citizen of Canada. Just as this is the sentiment which prompted our young men to volunteer in thousands to risk their lives on the battlefields of Africa, so it should be the sentiment with which this parliament should approach this question. I am not above giving advice nor am I afraid to give advice to the government of Britain upon- occasion, but I object to the character of the advice on this occasion. I object to the advice, I object still more strongly to what appears to be the motive behind that advice. The motion, as I understand it, is a motion demanding-I say demanding-in the name of the men we have sent and the money we have spent; demanding amnesty for the rebels of Cape Colony; for the men who have added treachery to treason; the men who have added murder and pillage to treachery; the men who are outside the law of civilization in any civilized country in the world ; the men whose lives, liberties or civil right are forfeit under the law of every civilized country.

So am I merciful, but my merciful feelings are towards those who are loyal to the empire, and not to the disloyal enemies of our empire. Let me ask : Who has suffered more in this war-the British or the Boers ? It may not be to our credit; unfortunately it is not to our credit; but it is a fact that the British feople have suffered more in blood and money than have the Boers up to this time, and I say, Sir, that in mercy to ourselves we demand that such means be taken as shall bring this war to an end. But it will never be brought to an end so long as our opponents-believing them to be sensible and self-respecting men-are allowed to remain under the impression that they can stav in the field and carry a gun with impunity. If the Boers are what they are; then there is only one way to secure peace and that is by fighting this war to a finish. There is onlv one way to secure safety to the British empire in South Africa ; there
is only one way to secure safety for the loyal people of South Africa, be they Britain, or Boer, or black, and that is by fighting this war to a finish and letting it be known from sea to sea in South Africa, that it does not pay to be treasonable and disloyal; that it does not pay to organize treason and sedition year after year; that it does not pay to pillage your loyal neighbours and then give up your gun and go home pretending to be a peaceable citizen. Let it be understood that that game is not a good one; let it be understood that it does not pay to do that kind of business, and when that is understood, then a long step will be taken towards peace in South Africa.
From the beginning of this war to the end, whenever Britain showed the slightest inclination to slacken the iron hand, what was the result ? Was it praise for the clemency of Britain 1 Was not the declaration heralded from every capital in Europe, and from city to city in the United States-I do not know but what it was whispered from house to house in some localities even in Canada-that Britain was getting weak; that it was fear or inability to cope with the conditions that led to that clemency ? In every case Britain's clemency was a mistake. It encouraged the continuance of the war ; and within the past week or two, because the Cape rebel Kritzinger was not put to the death penalty, as he richly deserved to be. it was heralded throughout the world that Britain was afraid to execute the death penalty upon him. Under these circumstances, I say that if these hon. members who moved and seconded this resolution are loyal to the empire-if they are

That

was tile argument that was used by those who were the enemies of Britain and of Canada, who were the enemies of civilization and liberty, of which throughout this world the prestige of the British empire is the greatest, if I should not go so far as to say the only safeguard. We are interested iu maintaining that prestige, man by man, in this country. Our citizens have done their share, some part of their share, at any rate, towards sustaining that prestige ; and I can only again express regret that it should have been the part of any members of this House, at a time when there was danger of Britain erring, as she has erred before in her negotiations with her enemies and ours-at a time when Canada is sending two thousand more of her song to fight the battles of the empire in South Africa- at a time when our men are dying day by day in South Africa for the glory and prestige of the empire and for ""the honour of Canada and the honour of every one of us in Canada-that this time and occasion should have been used by members of this House to move a resolution throwing discredit on the motives of Great Britain, and strengthening the enemies of Britain and Canada and of civilization and liberty and enlightenment throughout the world.

KEMP (East Toronto).,,SUPPLY-SOUTH AFRICAN WAR-TERMS OF PEACE.,,,"Mr. Speaker, I wish to add, in the fewest possible words, my protest against the resolution which has been introduced into this House to-day by the hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton). I never can find language to express myself to this House to my entire satisfaction ; but never have I been so much at a loss, as I am on this occasion, to find language to adequately express my feelings, I may say my indignation, at the terms of this resolution. I can only say that I consider that, not only is the present time inopportune for introducing such a resolution into this House, but if it were carried as the sense of this House, it would no doubt embarrass the British government in their present negotiations to bring about a peaceful settlement of the war that has been going on in South Africa. It would also, it seems to me, embarrass the Prime Minister in his negotiations with British statesmen when he goes to London in the coming June. But. Sir, the resolution is also inopportune because it offends the British people. It offends Englishmen all over the worid. It is inopportune because it is introduced on this day, which all Englishmen honour as the day of their patron saint, St. George. I also protest against introducing such questions into this House as wasting the time of the House. As soon as two or three members had expressed themselves on the resolution, the hon. member for North Norfolk was going around and trying to withdraw it. It was too serious and far-reaching a matter to be introduced with any such intention. I felt, when the hon. member for North Norfolk was talking, that

I have watched with interest the political wanderings of my hon. friend from North Norfolk. We saw him pass from a protectionist to a free trader, and from a free trader back to a protectionist, and from advocating a policy which would result in the annexation of this country to the United States to advocating that a regiment of British soldiers be stationed at the city of Quebec, though there was no more necessity for stationing a regiment of soldiers at the city of Quebec than there was at the city of Toronto. I have watched the hon. gentleman's inconsistencies in all these courses, and we see his inconsistency to-day in introducing this resolution.
He must have made his peace with the hon. member for Labelle (Mr. Bourassa), otherwise surely that hon. gentleman could not possibly give his support to one who made the ridiculous suggestions, on the eve of the last general elections, that we should station soldiers at Quebec. The hon. member for North Norfolk (Mr. Charlton) must have recanted that sentiment before he could have got the hon. member for Labelle to second this resolution. The hon. gentleman referred to the millions of dollars that we have spent in sending men to South Africa, our noble sons whom we despatched over there to risk their lives in this campaign. Well, we have spent but little over the $2,000,000, and certainly very little considering the great advantages we have always enjoyed under the protection of the British flag. What credit or honour is due to this government for the bravery of these men to whom the right hon. the Prime Minister referred ? What credit can this government take to itself for the conduct of that noble son of Canada, Lieut. Carruthers, and that other hero, Private Evans, who died so nobly on the veldt, and who, when he found his life blood ebbing fast away and his strength nearly gone, broke his rifle rather than allow it to fall into the hands of the. enemy, and Private Milligan, who left his wife and family in this country, where he was surrounded by all the luxuries of peace, and volunteered to go to South Africa and fight for the British flag ? Those men were not sent by this government at the expense of the tax payers of Canada, and this government is entitled to no credit for their sacrifices other than that which falls to them as citizens of the country which has produced such men. The hon. member (Mr. Charlton) referred to the fact that the object of the Boers was to drive Great Britain out of South Africa and make it a Boer republic, and yet he brings up this resolution. Can one understand his proposing such a resolution, admitting, as he

does, that the Boers were on the offensive from the start ? Who doubts Great Britain's generosity ? Nearly every hon. member who has spoken has referred to the generosity with which Great Britain has dealt with her defeated foes in the past. Who then doubts her generosity to deal with the Boers at the present ? Is Great Britain to-day less civilized than she was in years gone by ? Is she retrograding towards barbarism now ? I cannot, for my part, see what ground there is in the slightest degree for suspecting that Great Britain will not treat the Boers with the greatest possible consideration. Do we want another settlement such a& we had at Majuba Hill or when the British troops were withdrawn from Khartoum ? We had subsequently to go over the whole ground again and spend millions upon millions, and the loss of so much human life to reconquer in both cases, and we do not want any such weak-kneed administration or policy in Great Britain to-day as when Mr. Gladstone administered the affairs of the empire. I think that a greal deal of unnecessary sympathy in this discussion has been given the Boers. We have not heard very much said by those hon. members who have supported the resolution about the relatives of the 25,000 odd who have died on the veldt of South Africa, either from wounds or diseases, or about the billion of dollars which Great Britain is spending in defending her South African possessions. I think, with the hon. gentleman who has preceded me, that we ought to hear a little more in regard to this feature of the question. It ill becomes us, who are enjoying all the blessings of peace to interfere. Surely we can leave this difficulty to be settled by the statesmen and soldiers of Great Britain, who represent those who have borne the greater part of the brunt of the war. It is not only the lowly sons of Great Britain who have risked their lives in this war but the scions of her nobility as well. From every class, her children have gone and offered up their lives for the country, and it is the representatives of these on whom we can rely to deal out every justice to the enemy.
I think that this motion is a very ill advised one. I look upon it as embodying a mischievous policy, and regret very much that the question should have been introduced into this House at all. But I would suggest a resolution which, I think, would meet with almost the unanimous consent of the House, and which I drafted in the few moments at my leisure during recess. It is as follows :
That this parliament regrets that Mr. Kruger, the acting presidents and the generals of the Orange River and Transvaal Colonies who are stiil leading a small but brave remnant of the Boers, have not seen fit to cease the hostilities in which they took the initiative | against the British empire, by invading and, 106
annexing British territory. That we point them with pride to the great liberty and many privileges enjoyed by the people of this country, as well as the other parts of the empire, under British institutions by all races, creeds and-nationalities, and realizing the magnanimity shown in the past to ,a defeated foe we have tbs utmost confidence that the most generous terms of peace will be extended to the Boers by the statesmen and soldiers of Greaat Brb tain.
That is a resolution which nearly every member of this House I venture to think would support.

The amendment I would suggest Is as follows :
In the opinion of this House, it is not advisable to offer any advice or give any instructions to the British people relating to their duties regarding the Boers in South Africa, believing that the well known magnanimity and generosity always practised on all occasions by the British government will be exercised on the present occasion.
I think that that will fill the Bill. From what I have learned to-day, I am sure that it is not the desire of any hon. member of this House to say a word that would interfere with the making of peace between Britain and the Boers, and I think that the resolution introduced by the hon. member for North Norfolk will have that tendency. If carried in this House it would lead the Boers to believe that a large number of the people of Canada were in sympathy with them. I am satisfied that there are few people in sympathy with the Boers, except to the extent that the underdog is sympathized with. Britain has always shown magnanimity to her foes, and where is there any nation in the world which has shown it in the way she has done to her foes in South Africa ? Is she not educating the children of her foes ? Is she not supporting the lone and fatherless on the veldt ? Is she not doing everything she possibly can to conciliate these people ?
I contend that she is and doing it very graciously, and if we were to show sympathy to the Boers now, we would be not only encouraging them, but giving comfort-to many nations of Europe, which are only too pleased to see the British in difficulties.
They have shown their sympathy with the BoBrs throughout the whole of this war, and would have been only too glad, had they thought they could have done it, to assist the Boers. There is no doubt about that. But they know that Britons are united, that the old lion's teeth have not dropped out, that her whelps are around her and assisting her, that Canada has given her aid, and so have Australia, New Zealand and all other

336a

parts of the empire, and that they stand ready to back up Great Britain for the reason that they know she is right in this cause and for the reason that they are determined that the British empire shall not be dismembered by a few Boers or a few disaffected men in our own country. I make no insinuations against anybody. 1 do not think the brainy men of Great Britain will be coerced or cajoled or influenced by anything that members of this House say, and, therefore, I think it is time that we should refrain from discussing this matter any further. Mr. Speaker, I hope that if you put my amendment, it will carry.

Mr. Speaker, after what has fallen from the lips of the right lion, the leader of this House (Sir Wilfrid Laurier), and of the hon. member for Jacques Cartier (Mr. Monk), the lieutenant of the leader of the opposition, who have, in such eloquent language, spoken the sense of this House in favour of the peace negotiations being brought to a satisfactory conclusion, I should certainly have refrained from participating in this debate. But as the hon. member for Victoria (Mr. Hughes) and the hon. member for Alberta (Mr. Oliver) have deemed it fit to give a new trend to the debate, and as they have insinuated that some hon. gentlemen were not in favour of peace and harmony being restored in South Africa, and were not anxious to see an end put to this struggle that has been in progress for three years, I think it opportune, under such circumstances, to protest against such statements.
The hon. member for Victoria, in his speech, referred to rebels, and stated that many revolutions have been justifiable. But, Sir, do you know under which circumstances nowadays rebellion is not justifiable, and when the right to rebel of a people can be questioned ? It is when the rebels are vanquished. But when they triumph, and when victory perches on their banners, oh, then it is quite another question, and we find it recorded in history that they had a right to rebel, and that the righteousness of their cause cannot be questioned. In 1837, we had a rebellion in Canada. In Upper Canada and in Lower Canada the patriots rebelled, not against Great Britain, but against a bad and tyrannical government. But is it not agreed on all hands to-day that those patriots had a right to rebel against that oligarchy, and that they had serious grievances ? From the events that transpired in this country, in the province of Que-Mr. ROBINSON.
bee, we ought to learn a lesson, and it is that it is always bad policy for a victorious foe to wreak resentment upon a vanquished people, and that sooner or later, when the recoil ensues, the vanquished foe will resent that treatment. The memory of those heroes DeLorimier and his unfortunate companions is still living in the hearts of their fellow-countrymen. Had Colborne shown magnanimity, and extended to the foes the right hand of fellowship, would he not have better secured peace and harmony between the two races in our country ? Nobody, I think, will question that it would have been good policy to have pursued such a course.
I agree that the social fabric must be upheld and order secured in the community, but the victors can always afford to accord a generous treatment to the vanquished, without any danger or peril.
By the resolution which is now before the House, we tell the imperial parliament-provided this resolution should ever reach parliament-that, in our opinon, the Boer cause is lost, that British supremacy should be maintained in South Africa, but we further affirm that the broadest policy of magnanimity and mercy should be extended to a brave foe now opposing British arms. We further tell the vanquished that they may look forward with confidence to the future, and that, when they have laid down their arms, they shall have the franchise and every right of the British subject, and enjoy the boon of a wise and just administration.
When the American colonies which now form the United States of America rebelled against Great Britain, eloquent voices were heard in the British parliament in favour of a policy of magnanimity, but, unfortunately, those voices appealed in vain to the sense of justice of parliament, and what was the result, Sir ? The result was that the finest British colonies were lost to the mother country.
Mr. Speaker, as I said at the outset, if all the hon. gentlemen who have participated in this debate had taken their cue from the right hon. the leader of this House, who has displayed, throughout the whole of his speech, a judicial spirit and a serenity which are the true characteristics of statesmanship,
I would have refrained from interfering in the debate ; but I thought it my duty, the more so as I pride myself on my descent from one of those rebels who, in the course of this century, fought for securing freedom to their fellow-countrymen-to protest against the intemperate language used this evening by some hon. gentlemen in this House. And if there is some ill-feeling* against England still rankling in the hearts of my fellow-countrymen, the reason is to be found in the fate of those unfortunate fellow-countrymen of ours who died on the scaffold. That is our main grievance against England. And when I heard, this evening, a Christian gentleman appeal to us in the name of civilization, and tell us that it is

the duty of a nation to take revenge of her fallen foe, I could not help regretting that, principles so utterly at variance with the tenets of our modern civilization should still be taught and upheld in this country of ours. These are growing times, Sir, and in this twentieth century we ought to keep abreast of the spirit of the times. In former times there iwas no mercy, no magnanimity exercised by the conquerors to the conquered ; and a fallen foe was reduced to slavery. But, nowadays, the very moment a man lays down liis arms, his life is held sacred. Nowadays when a vanquished foe lays, down his arms, not only is his life spared, but he is also entitled to whatever makes for the happiness of life ; the enjoyment of freedom and of his property.
Mr. 'SPEAKER. Is it the pleasure of the House that the hon. gentleman (Mr. Charlton) have leave to withdraw his motion.

It does not matter what one undertakes to-day, the cost is materially increased. This is due, no doubt, to an increase in the cost of living, and an advance in the scale of living. The result is that one cannot get people to do work for what one could get the same class of people to do work for ten years ago.
In 1891 there was a general lack of employment throughout the country, whereas in 1901 the contrary was the case, and employment was seeking the people rather than the people seeking employment. For that reason it was necessary to establish a higher scale of pay than the scale of 1891. The pay in 1891 was sufficient to attract a large number of people to census employment, but in 1901, on the contrary, it was found rather difficult to get people to do this work, even with the higher scale of pay. Another reason for the increased cost, was that in the census of 1901 a great many more questions were asked by the enumerators, and
the filling up of the schedules required more time and labour. For this reason a good deal more labour was thrown upon the commissioners. Then there was the additional fact that in 1901 there were several territories and outlying districts which had to be covered by enumerators, and which had not to be covered, or not to the same extent, in 1891. This involved a considerable additional expense, and an expense greater in proportion than the additional number of people to be taken in file same section of country. In those outlying sections population is sparse, and the difficulties of the enumerators were greater. Even in those territories and sparsely settled parts of Canada where the enumeration was taken in 1891. there was a larger number of people to he enumerated in 1901, because the population had increased during the decade. There was also the fact that we undertook to take the census of 1901 in a shorter time, to do it more rapidly, so as to get the returns sooner before the people. For this purpose we employed a larger number of enumerators, and although the actual population to be taken by them was not so very much larger, the increased number of enumerators did cost a larger amount than a smaller number would have cost to do the same work, the object being to take the census more rapidly and to get the results quicker. These different reasons, shortly stated will, I think, account for the increased expense which the hon.. gentleman has alluded to. No doubt lion, gentlemen will ask questions with regard to this matter, and I shall be happy to answer them to the best of my ability.

It will he admitted by every manufacturer in tnis country that wages have not increased materially during the last ten years. I know it is not so in our town, and I think our town will compare favourably with any other town in the country. Then he says that the territories are now better filled up than in 1891. Well, if the population in the territories was sparse it would cost more to take the enumeration. I think the argument he advanced in reference to the territories is an argument against himself. I find that under the late government the census was taken three times. In 1871 it cost $511,000 ; in 1881 it cost $552,000 ; in 1891 it cost $549,000. Now the Minister of Agriculture, in reply to a question on the 3rd of March, stated that he had already expended $948,000. I asked the question the other day how much was expended up to the 3rd of April, and he made the same reply, $948,000. Now will the hon. gentleman tell us what the expenditure has been up to date on the census ?

The men, I understand, have refused to accept the reduction, and are to all intents and purposes on strike. Lawyers have been employed and the matter is to be taken into the courts at great cost to the men who, in the meantime, are left unpaid. Now, if I understand the object of the Labour Bureau, it is to settle such disputes as this, and see that the workingman gets fair treatment. Without passing any judgment on the dispute one way or another, it is. reasonable to assume that there is good ground for the stand the men have taken, or their lawyers would not have advised them to take it into the courts. It would be a great triumph for the Bureau of Labour if it stepped in now and effected a settlement of the whole trouble.
The hon. minister says that it was by piecework they were to be paid, but I would draw his attention to the fact that the instructions given to the census enumerators in regard to their employment were something like the following :
The day's work of census officers, commissioners', enumerators and other employees for the taking of census will consist of eight hours of proved effective service, and all overtime will be allowed as part of a day at the same rate of enumeration as is provided for a day's work. Ten hours of proved effective service *rtill count as one day and one-quarter and twelve hours as one day and one-half.
If the payment was to be by the name, what was the necessity for stating what would constitute a day's work. It goes on to say :
Section 24 of the Act reads as follows :
The Minister of Agriculture shall cause to be prepared one or more tables setting forth the rates, allowances, or remuneration of the several census commissioners and enumerators, which rates shall not exceed in the aggregate a total amount of $3 for each jlay of good effective service for any enumerator; or $4 for each day of like service for any census commissioner.
That seems to indicate plainly that they were hired by the day. Referring to this matter, ' Events ' says :
Hon. Mr. Scott, who is acting Minister of Agriculture, and therefore, for the time being, head of the Census Department, has given an interview to the press in which he declares that the enumerators have only themselves to blame for falling into the error that they were to get $3 a day for eight hours work. He says the basis of payment was plainly stated to them at the start.	.
Well, they have not themselves to blame at all. The instructions issued by the government clearly led the enumerators to that conclusion. As * Events ' says, if the Bureau of Labour was of any value whatever, the Deputy* Minister of Labour should have been called in to settle the dispute between the employer and the employee. The
men being helpless had no recourse against the government, and they feel to-day that they have been deliberately cheated out of what they regard as their honest wages. They cannot sue the government, of course, unless the government allows them, and so they have to grin and bear it.

Which rate shall not exceed in the aggregate the total amount of $3 per day for each day of proper effective service for any enumerator, or $4 for each day of like service for any commissioner.
They were not to be paid a fixed sum per day, but they were to be paid by a schedule of rates, which schedule should in no case allow an enumerator to earn more than $3 per day, or a commissioner more than $4. They were to be allowed $3 for eight hours work If they had done enough work by the schedule of rates to justify their earning $3 per day. The House can understand that if they were simply paid at a fixed rate per day, there would be no inducement to do an effective day's work, but if they were paid by the schedule of rates under which they had to do a certain amount of work to earn $3 a day, that was a stimulus to them to do that amount of work. As a matter of fact, a considerable number of enumerators would have earned by the schedule more than $3 a day, but they were only paid that amount because the Act does not allow us to pay any more. There were other enumerators who by the schedule of rates did not earn as much as $3 per day, and it would not be fair, as between man and man, to pay those who did comparatively little as much as those who did a great deal more work.

1901 was very much greater throughout the country than in 1891, and consequently we had to* adopt a higher schedule of rates, which probably involved two-thirds of the increased cost. Next, we had to take the census of the Yukon, Athabasca and Keewa-tin territories, which were not included in the census of 1891, Thirdly, in the territories which were included in the census of 1891 there were large areas in which there was no population at all. no enumerators appointed, and no expenditure ; but in the census of 1901 every nook and corner of the territories was more or less occupied and enumerators were appointed, and very heavy expenditure was incurred because of the scattered nature of the population. Fourthly, our census enumerators in 1901 had very much more extensive schedules and had to ask a great many more questions, which took a longer time and required them to do fewer households in a day than was the case in 1891, In the census of 1891 the schedules contained 21(3 questions, while in the schedules of 1901 there were (523 questions, or 407 more, or practically three times as many.

I would have to go through the list to learn how many there were in Ontario. But where the circumstances were peculiar it was sometimes deemed advisable to appoint two commissioners, especially was that the case where there was a considerable proportion of people representing the two different languages that are current in this country. If there was a large area, that was another reason. Speaking from memory, I think that in the hon. gentleman's constituency the appointment of two was due to the fact that there Mr. BENNETT.
is a considerable French population in that riding.

And as to the plea of extended area, I may tell the minister that one of the commissioners unfortunately is a very bad cripple, a man who cannot walk about, but has to be lifted. One can readily understand how he could get over a large area of country. I may explain the circumstances to the minister to refresh his memory. One of these appointees was recommended by the Liberal candidate for the local legislature, and the other by the defeated candidate for the Commons. Both had to be appointed, and the country has to pay for them. If that is a fair sample of the way the census was conducted all over the country, it is clear that the great expense lias been due to the fact that so much has had to be done out of consideration for political exigencies.

In the past no such record has been available. However, I formed my judgment on what I believed to be the general consensus of opinion and of knowledge in the country that the remuneration of all classes of skilled and clerical labour was higher than it had been, and also upon the fact that while in 1891 there wore a large number of temporarily unemployed and idle people, in 1901 there were comparatively few people who were not busily engaged in one kind of work or another who were not prepared to leave their work for temporary employment, and who could not leave their employment with advantage unless they got a fair remuneration.

On looking over this list of enumerators for East Simcoe, I see in it the same old gang of political heelers of the Liberal party. It would not be a question of fitness, for that certainly was not the question in the selection of enumerators there, because we find that they were the old time division court clerks, license inspectors, bailiffs, and men of that ilk. These were tne enumerators for the riding of East Simcoe. As to their fitness by reason. of educatioii, I can only tell the minister that if the men got correct returns in East Simcoe, then I am very much mistaken. What are the facts of this census ? Let us take the province of Ontario. We find that there has been an increase in the province of 53,(557. In the cities of Ottawa, Toronto, Hamilton, London and Brantford there has been an increase of 55,900 odd, so that in the bulk of the province of Ontario the population, instead of increasing, has gone backwards. ' Can any one believe that in ridings where 1,he population was tumbling from 22,000 to 17,900-and this has gone on throughout the province generally, though I am glad to say not in all the ridings-there would be such a scarcity of men to do the work that the minister had to increase the pay ? As I have pointed out, party exigencies drove him to appoint two commissioners in the riding of East Simcoe, which of course increased the cost accordingly. Then he had to increase the number of enumerators from 27 in 1891 to 65 in 1901. I will refresh the minister's memory as to one of the requirements that were to be exacted from these enumerators. I suppose the minister has not forgotten the famous circular : first, on your oath, do not give anything away ; and next, send to the county secretary the names of all the lads in your division who are approaching 21. I think that is the reason why a good many of these men in East Simcoe were chosen-that they would have an utter disregard of their oath of office, and would do what I know they were doing-going about the riding getting all this information preparatory to ""the revision of the voters' lists last fall. I can only speak of that one riding, but I have no doubt that if the non.

gentlemen study the lists in tlieir own rulings, they will find the same thing there- that' these men were selected as enumerators because they would be useful from a party point of view, and that is the reason thev were not g'oing to do the work at the rate that had been in force in 1891, but demanded a higher rate. That is the reason the minister was moved-and I suspect that the greatest pull came from the province of Ontario-to increase the rate from 3 cents per head to 5 cents. The minister cannot make any reasonable man believe that in those parts of the province of Ontario from which people were fleeing as if from a pestilence, it was difficult to obtain men to do the work. In East Simcoe these little doles which were given out to those men were perfect Godsends to them. A number of them were men who were pursuing their ordinary avocations, and this was money simply thrown to them on the side. It will not do for the minister to try to convince the country that these men were paid these excessive rates to take the census, because there was no complaint that the enumerators were under paid in 1891. It was simply and solely because they were so hungry that they had to be paid an excessive amount, and it was thrown to them as a sop and nothing else. The statement that the cost of labour had increased so much in the province of Ontario will not apply in East Simcoe, because most of these enumerators have no ordinary avocation save being hangers-on to a political party ; and I am bound to sav that if other members go through the lists of their own ridings, they will have the same experience there as I have had in East Simcoe. It was the hungry cry of the party followers, driven on by the members behind him, which drove the minister to increase the rates in 1901 over what was paid in 1891.

His principal reason is that wages have increased between 1891 and 1901. We have some means of making a comparison. I have before me the report of the Ontario Bureau of Industries for the two periods, and I find that the wages of farm labourers in 1891 were $25.81 a month, and in 1901, $20.14. or a difference of 33 cents a month. Surely that cannot account for it. I think the ministei will be obliged to look around and find some other reason. He will certainly not find people in Ontario, who have been in the habit of employing men, agree with him that the difference in wages can account for the increase. Take the riding of East Grey. I find that in 1891 it cost $1,324 to take the census, whereas in 1901 it cost $3 500. or more than twice as much, notwitstanding the fact-and I speak from experience because I have been hiring men all along-that the wages paid in 1891 were about the same as were paid in 1901. When

these gentlemen were appealing to the people. they said that if they got into office they would make the country a cheap one to live in, but according to the minister it is dearer, because he says that on account of the increased cost of living we have to pay more wages.

The hon. member who has just spoken must remember that the question of the cost of living is one that must always be considered in connection with the wages paid. Suppose a man gets $2 per day this year where he got $1 per day ten years ago, will it be fair to say that because his living cost him 50 cents per day when he only got a dollar, and .$1 per day when he gets $2, that the cost of living has increased ? In the one case he is 50 cents a day better off than the other. Speaking for my own county, except in two districts,
I had not an application to appoint a man to take the census. I had to- enumerate good men myself and ask them to do the work, except in two districts. My county is divided into two municipalities. In the one, in order that the work might be well done, I asked the warden of one of the districts if he would not he the commissioner for that particular district and he consented, in the other I appointed one of the best men I could And, who never applied at all. It may be different elsewhere, but I do not believe there is a man who took the census m Nova Scotia-I know there was none in the county of Guysborough-who could not make more money at something else during the time he took to do that work. The remuneration after all was not so very great; and 1 did not think that even in Ontario taking the census would be found such a very lucrative job. It certainly was not considered so in the province of Nova Scotia, and nobody was scrambling for the positions. We had to look for the men to take them.

My hon. friend from Simcoe informed the minister a few moments ago that the population of Ontario during the ten years had increased by 53,000 souls, while the population of four cities that lie named had made up that total increase. Now where has the increase taken place ? In all the smaller towns, villages and rural municipalities there is not a man in Ontario to-day who is satisfied with the census. I have before me tlie census in our town, and I find that in 1891 it was 3,069, and by this census it is 3,526. Here is a certificate from the county clerk taken from the assessment roll that simply gives the heads of families and their children. It takes the same count that the enumerators are supposed to take, and the assessor was doing the work at the same time that the enumerators were. The town clerk says :
Gananoque, October 17, 1901. The assessment roll for the town of Ganano-que for the present year, 1901, shows the popu-lation'to be 3,718.
(Sgd.) SAMUEL McCALLUM,
Town Clerk.
The enumerators of the hon. gentleman give the population as 3,526, or 192 less than the population in our town taken in the same month by the town authorities. I would like to know how the hon. gentleman will account for the great discrepancy there. Besides the four cities the member for Simcoe named show an increased population more than the total increase for Ontario that the hon. gentleman shows by his census. He must know, as everybody in Ontario knows, that the census for Ontario is not correct, because the Ontario Bureau of Statistics show a much larger increase, and my hon. friend here proved by the Ontario
Bureau of Statistics, made up by the same gentleman who has been at the head of this census staff, that the wages paid in 1891 were within 23 cents a month as high as those paid in 1901. The minister himself says that the men doing this kind of work must understand clerical work, and lie is paying to-day just the same prices that were paid for doing the same clerical work as was done in 1891. $1.50 and $2 a day-that is wliat they were paid in 1891. Where is the increase ? In the city of Ottawa, where living ought to be dearer, if in any place, lie is giving his staff the same pay as was given in 1891. namely. SI.t>0 and $2 a day. The hon. gentleman has at the head of his staff the same gentleman .who took the census during the two last decades, lie had the same machinery, but he had to find jobs [DOT] for his friends. What are the facts to-day? The present census will cost, by the time it is completed, more than double what the last census did. to say nothing about that $6,000 a year rent he is paying for a building that will not hold the staff doing the work. Let anybody go down to that building and say if $6,000 a year rent is not an outrageous price to pay for it, besides spending $10,000 or $12,000 for fitting it up. That is how this economical government are running the affairs of the country, and it is so in every department. This is a plain kind of work that any man ought to be able : to do, at least for the same amount of money that it cost ten years ago. The fact 1 is that labour lias not increased, ns proved by statistics here, and by gentlemen who are employing men. I have some 60 men employed in my factory at Gananoque. doing the same kind of work that they did ten years ago, and they are drawing the same pay now that they did then, and it is the same in every other factory.

The hon. gentleman admits that he is paying his staff in the city of Ottawa just what the late government paid ten years ago, namely, $1.50 and $2 a day. But how did he obtain his staff ?
I am informed that each supporter behind him and each defeated candidate have a right to name one clerk to come down here on the census staff-213 clerks sent down from 213 constituencies in the Dominion of Canada, to fill this building renting at $6,000 a year, and they are crammed in there, tumbling over one another. But there had to be one taken on from each constituency, and I presume that if each supporter and each defeated candidate had the privilege of naming five clerks there would have been five from each constituency taken on, because I understood that more came than the

hon. gentleman could find room for. The minister will find that the estimate he made the other day that it would cost $170,000 more to complete the census, will be exceeded, and that it will take a quarter of a million dollars more to complete a work that was done in 1891 for $549,000. The city of Kingston had a census taken, and they eiaim a large shrinkage. Owen Sound, Toronto, and almost every other place has had a similar experience. In many cases they were so disappointed that they had the census taken over again, and the Minister of Agriculture has heard from them. Ontario does not show anything like the population which is given by the Bureau of Statistics.
Mr. OLIVER, The case I have to lay before the minister is the direct opposite of that of these hon. gentlemen. They complain of the minister having spent too much money, but my complaint is that he has been too careful in his expenditure.

to the cost of the census of 1901 this investigation made as to the census of 1891. I think this is a very important question which I will refer to again when I get the amount. It has always been my impression that the way in which we vote money is extremely vague, and I maintain that a study of the estimates and the voting of the estimates would be much shorter and much less of verbal explanation would be called for, if every item gave distinctly the purpose for which the money was asked. Anybody who takes the trouble to go over the estimates, will, I am sure, come to the conclusion that a ""great many questions which are asked on this side of the House would not be asked if the object for which the money is to be voted were clearly designated. But, outside of the general consideration, it seems to me a most preposterous act on the part of the government to take this specific vote given by this House, under the supreme authority which we possess, for the census of one decade, to take a sum which must have been very considerable out of that vote, to make an investigation as to the census of the decade previous. 1 believe there was no authority whatever, and when there has been such a flagrant violation of fact that what has happened in this case has sound principle, I am perfectly convinced that a careful examination of the ends to. Which the money is put, and under the loose system in which we vote it, will reveal the fact that what has happened in this case has happened in a variety of other cases. I will confine my attention to this particular case, and I say it is an absolute violation of the rules and principles which should govern us and which ought to be taken notice of by every fair and impartial member of this House, because we may be on the other side of the House to-thoTrow. It is gross violation of principle that a sum voted for such a specific object as this should be devoted to defraying the expenses of the investigation which was made into the census of 1891. I would ask the hon. minister to explain upon what authority he has violated one of the fundamental rules which should govern us in our financial conduct in this House ?

I felt that the investigation into the accuracy of the census of 1891 was called for, because of the results of the census of 1901 which showed very extraordinary decreases of population in a great many places where the people of the locality were quite satisfied that such decreases could not have occurred. In other cases where the increases were very small indeed the question arose as to how this could be accounted for. It was a question concerning the census of 1901 ana when the suggestion was made, and which came naturally to the minds of many people, that the census of 1891 was unduly swelled and that the apparent anomalies

which existed between the results of the census of 1891 and the results of the census of 1901 were perfectly explainable if we could show that the census of 1891 was unduly swelled, which I think we could show, and which I think we did show, es-pecialy in the province of Quebec, it would be a sufficient explanation of these apparent anomalies and would be a confirmation of the results of the census of 1901. I therefore considered that the results of the census of 1891 were bound up with the question in such a way that the expenditure for this purpose seemed to be perfectly legitimate out of this vote for taking the census of 1901.

There were Acadians in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and French Canadian people in Ontario and Manitoba. But there was only one description of them, that of French Canadians. A great many of these people, especially
the Acadians, did not return themselves as French Canadians, thinking that ' French Canadian' was a term applied only to the French Canadian habitant of the province of Quebec. There were a large number of people of French origin, and of the Catholic religion, and who are really French nationality, but who were not returned as French Canadians. I think that was the complaint made by certain French Canadian members on the floor of this House after the census of 1891.

That charge so repeatedly made will have to be sifted to the bottom. I can tell hon. members that the people of the province of Quebec, part of whom I represent here, have keenly felt that charge. AVe are Conservatives and Liberals in the province of Quebec and we have our political difficulties as other people have. But I should be very sorry to rise in this House and charge that the Liberal enumerators of 1901 were perjurers. And what is still stranger than the fact of such a charge being made concerning the enumerators of 1891 is the fact that it is proven out of the mouth of our Roman Catholic clergy. We will see the bottom of that before this item passes. For my part, I am prepared to suspend judgment until we have before us all the documents we have a right to see.

In 1891 Goderich was returned as having a population of about 4,000. After a lapse of ten years this gentleman goes up there. He does not make a single statement on his own authority, but what he says is ' after making careful inquiries of different old residents.' I suppose he took old people because their memory might he at fault and they might be easily persuaded to agree to what he said. This statement the Minister of Agriculture read out to show that the list for Goderich had been stuffed. The census was taken early in the year 1891. Now, take the first name mentioned as having been improperly included in the census list. This is Elizabeth Tebutt, who was enumerated twice, once in Goderich township and once in Clinton. I know nothing of the case, but I presume this woman was a domestic. She may have been at her home in Goderich township when the enumerator went around, and was proba bly included in the census again by the enumerator for Clinton where she was working. Now, the town of Goderich is a lake port of importance and a number of vesels run in and out of there. I find the name Worthington given here with the remarks that this party was in Chicago in 1891, and another party was in Buffalo, and so on. These men were probably vessel men, and were properly taken by the enumerator at Goderich. Everybody knows that a man connected with a vessel leaves home in the spring for the fitting-out work that is done on the boat. If the bulk of these cases were inquired into, I have no doubt it would be found that these men lived in Goderich and their occupation was such as to take them away during a part of the year. One is represented here as having been in Winnipeg, one in St. Paful, one in Vancouver, and others in other places. What does that indicate ? It indicates that this very inquisitive gentleman-who, I have no doubt we shall find out later on was well paid for his inquisitiveness-learned the names of people who. at some time of the year were away. He does not say that they were away the whole year. They may have been there in 1891 when the census was taken and been away in the fall. On this list are the names of the enumerators whose work is here impugned. Have they been asked for an explanation ?

To pay this staff it will cost $250,000, to say nothing of the commissioner and the other members of the staff. My hon. friend does not expect to get through in less than two years from March last. The expenditure up to that time is $948,000 to say nothing of the commissioner, or rent, or tlie other members of the staff. This is the ordinary list of pay clerks who are receiving $1.25, $1.60, $1.75, and up to $2 a day. There is one man drawing $100 a month on the list, and he is the only one that I have noticed receiving that amount. I am prepared to say that before the work is

completed $1,250,000 will be nearer the amount expended than the sum stated by the minister.

matter of the most earnest consideration on the part of the government. A good deal of correspondence has taken place on this subject between the Colonial Office and the Canadian government.
Canada wants men, plenty of men ; in the Ncrth-west Territories and towards British Columbia there are thousands of square miles that are lying waiting for settlers. The Boers are the sort of settlers that the Canadian government is looking for. The Dominion government proposes to give a full homestead, consisting of 160 acres of land, to each head of a family that will settle down, as well as to each male over twenty-one, to assist them with money-as settlers are at present assisted-and to admit them to the same terms of civil liberty as any settler.
