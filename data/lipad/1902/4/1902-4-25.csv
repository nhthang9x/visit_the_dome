That it is expedient to provide for the appointment of an assistant commissioner of the North-west mounted police for the Yukon territory, at $1,600 per annum.
The PRIME MINISTER (Rt. Hon. Sir Wilfrid Laurier) the object of the Bill of which this resolution is a preliminary is simply to authorize the government to appoint a second assistant commissioner of the Mounted Police. At present there is a comptroller of the Mounted Police stationed at Ottawa and a commissioner stationed at Regina. The object is to appoint an assistant commissioner stationed at the Yukon. The force in the Yukon is now under Superintendent Wood, a most competent officer. But some difficulty has arisen from the fact that, instead of being able to deal directly with matters concerning the Yukon he has to report to the commissioner at Regina, who has again to report to Ottawa. It would avoid many difficulties and promote the efficiency of the force if Mr. Wood were made an assistant commissioner and clothed with the powers of a commissioner, as is the assistant commissioner at Regina in the absence of the commissioner, and so be able to deal with all matters in the Yukon and report directly to Ottawa. The only increase of expenditure involved would be $200. At present Mr. Wood receives $1,400 a year with, of course, the allowance which is made to the officers in the Yukon. As assistant commissioner he will receive the same as the assistant commissioner at Regina, $1,600.",,,,

As I pointed out when I introduced the resolution, the registrar has been in the habit of receiving, under an agreement as he represents, an annual increase of about $50 a year, the original intention being to increase his salary to $2,400. At the present time, as a result of the actual increases given to him, his salary amounts to $2,375. In order to get rid of this obligation to take an annual vote for the sum of $50, we suggest the propriety of fixing the salary at $2,400, which he says was the amount at which it was fixed originally.

Londons April 25.-The 'Daily Mail' affirms this morning that the agreement of the Atlantic shipping combine contains secret clauses to the effect that the American promoters of the concern intend to ask congress to pass a new shipping bill permitting foreign built vessels to be
brought under the American flag. The adhesion of the 'Cunard' line is practically certain, continues the 'Mail,' and the corporation will be formed mainly with American capital. It will take over entirely the British shipping companies. Those companies refusing to Join the combine will be compelled to fight for their existence. For the three or four years that the present admiralty contracts still have to run, the paper adds, the vessels will remain under the British flag, at the expiration of this time the whole will pass under the American dag and he owned and run by the above mentioned corporation-, which will eventually -endeavour to carry its competition to every portion of the globe.
The 'Daily Express' declares that the shipping combine is trying to coerce Canada into accepting its terms and conditions as- to emigration- rates and traffic and that, if resistance is made, the combine will buy up th? Canadian railways and declare a commercial war. It is the intention of the combine, says the ' Daily Express' to demand that the Canadian emigration department in London should cease to give facilities to Elder, Dempster and Company.
This, seems to me, to be striking a vital blow at the shipping interests of Canada, as it strikes a blow at British shipping, it as a matter of course, includes Canadian shipping as well. It strikes a vital blow at those interested in commerce and manufactures and all interested in trade generally. It goes on further and says that they wiil also include traffic by railways and that if a resistance is made they will buy up the Canadian railways and declare commercial war. This seems to me to be very bold reference or statement and if carried out would interfere very -materially not only with the maritime provinces bordering on the Atlantic, but with Canada as a whole. It is declared that the trade of Canada is to be diverted from our Canadian roads across the American boundary to American ports, and in this way our seaports on the Atlantic will be seriously affected. It would not only interfere with our commercial interests but it would interfere with oar ship-building interests, and very materially affect the county which I have the honour to represent, having no less than forty new vessels building in the county of Lunenburg this year, and last year we had about a similar number constructed. This referred-to project would place us in the position of having not only the ship-building industry, now a success, hampered, but our general trade greatly crippled. I would ask the right hon. leader of the government (Sir Wilfrid Laurier) to consider this matter very carefully, to view the situation as it might ultimately exist and place such safeguards around the interests of Canada as to prevent our being interfered with in this way. I only saw this matter mentioned iu the referred-to paper a few minutes before the House met this afternoon, and thought it my duty, in the interest of all concerned, more particularly for those interested in commerce and trade, that the matter should be brought to the attention of the House. I

EMMERSON (Westmoreland).,,SUPPLY-ATLANTIC SHIPPING COMBINE.,,,"It was not my intention to offer any observations on the subject now before this committee, nor indeed to take part in any of the proceedings of the House during the present session, in obedience to the command of my physician, who had enjoined upon me the necessity of abstaining as much as possible from any work which would involve any mental strain or excitement. The extraordinary character of the speeches which were delivered here last evening, and the way in which my name was used, constrain me to make a few remarks with respect to the Intercolonial Railway. Representing, as I do, a constituency which is very largely interested in that road, which is, indeed, the head centre of the government railway system, it might perhaps be expected of me that I would make some remarks when such a subject was under discussion.
Before referring to the remarks personal to myself which were made by the hon. gentlemen who have already spoken, I would like to invite the attention of this committee and of the country to the circumstances under which the Intercolonial Railway was
constructed. I think that a reference to the 145th section of the British North America Act will convince all hon. members of the committee that the construction and maintenance of that road was one of the essential features of the coming into this confederation of the provinces by the sea. Indeed, that 145th section was the stepping stone upon which the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick entered the threshold of this great Dominion, and therefore the people of those provinces are naturally very much intefested not only in the maintenance of that road and its proper management, but they are particularly interested in the road being kept in such a condition that there shall not be any prejudice created in the minds of the people of any other section of Canada against it, or against its maintenance as a government road.
Now, while it is true that in going over the history of the Intercolonial Railway and looking at its balance sheets year by year we do not find any large surpluses on the right side of the account, yet I am prepared to say that the Intercolonial Railway has been one of the most splendid assets that the government of Canada has ever possessed. I do not feel that I can show it in dollars and cents, but I think I can show this committee and the country that the dividends which it has earned have been of incalculable value. I need only refer to the first ten years of the history of this Dominion, before we had an Intercolonial Railway. Take the conditions which then prevailed. Even when the provinces by the sea sent to this parliament representatives of the people, how did they come to the city of Ottawa to attend to their duties? Only through American territory. Many were obliged to go to Portland by steamer and thence to Montreal by the Grand Trunk. Those conditions prevailed not only with respect to the assembling of the parliament of Canada, but in many other ways. When I started out as a young man to obtain a technical education, did I look to the province of Ontario or to the province of Quebec? Were my eyes turned to the great University of McGill or to the University of Toronto ? No ; and mine is only one of many cases. Where did we receive our technical education ? Passing from our higher schools, we were compelled to go to the neighbouring republic, across the waters of the Bay of Fundy, to Massachusetts or to universities in other parts of the American republic. The relationships between the provinces were such that we hardly knew each other. We were rather led to believe that the great province of Quebec was an impassable barrier between us and the province of Ontario. We did not know each other. Those who studied our geographies knew that there was a city of Montreal, it is true, but we were chiefly impressed with the fact that it was near Caughnawaga. that euphonious name

rather attracting the attention of the school student of that day. There was not much commercial intercourse or social intercourse between us. We were a separated people. What is true with respect to the educational features, is true with respect to all the conditions of life; and the construction of the Intercolonial Railway changed those conditions. If I may be pardoned for referring to myself, I was compelled to go to an American university; but I can refer witli pride to the fact that my son is attending McGill University; and what has brought about these changed conditions ? I think there is no element which has contributed more than the construction of the Intercolonial Railway. We now know each other as we did not know each other previous to that time. With respect to the province of Quebec, there was created in our minds as young students a prejudice against it; but the intercourse, social and otherwise, the interchange of trade, and the communications which have been provided toy means of the Intercolonial Railway have removed that prejudice. I remember the time in the maritime provinces when there was a prejudice against the great province of Ontario, when to call a man a Canadian was regarded as applying to him a term of opprobrium. We knew of Toronto, it is true : but studying our geographies, we knew of it as a city that was somewhere near the great Falls of Niagara.
When we took up our history we read of it as a city which in the war of 1812, had a number of its buildings, including the parliament buildings, destroyed. We knew of these things, but there was a separation between the people of the west and the people of the east These conditions were however changed by the opening up of the Intercolonial Railway. Then began the inrush into the maritime provinces of the commercial travellers from our western cities. Before that road was built, if any young man wanted a suit of clothes and could not get. what he desired at home, he would never think of going to Montreal or Toronto, but would run over to Boston. But all that has been changed and the people of eastern Canada have acquired knowledge with respect to the people of Ontario and Quebec which they did not formerly possess. We are to-day one people. We can go to the province of Quebec and give the hand of welcome to our brethren there ; we can go into the great province of Ontario and there meet our fellow-citizens as Canadians all. All these prejudices, which formerly existed, have disappeared, and in their place a national spirit has been engendered, to which I am sure the construction and maintenance of the Intercolonial Railway has contributed more than any other event in our history. It seems to me that we should discuss this question from a national standpoint. The expenditures on that road should be discussed in no carping Mr. EMMERSON.
spirit, and I was surprised to hear hon. members from the west on the opposite side speak in the way they did. I had supposed that they were the only true apostles of imperialism. That they were at least the great fed-erationists of the Dominion. They lay that flattering unction to their souls sometimes in their speeches, but in discussing this great national highway of Canada they did not show the broad national spirit which the subject demands. They did not approach it in a Canadian spirit but rather with a regard for sectionalism. When the ex-minister of railways (Mr. Haggart) and the hon. gentleman who followed him (Mr. Barker) referred to the expenditure, I wondered how the views which they expressed were accepted by their colleagues from the maritime provinces wiho sit on the other side. If the hon. gentlemen wanted to discredit and depreciate the Intercolonial Railway before the people of Canada, in the interests of some great corporations, if it was their intention to discredit that road and place it in such a position before the minds of the people of Canada that they would be ready to transfer its ownership to some great corporation, they took the very methods that would best tend to the accomplishment of that object. And I am sure that their utterances cannot .in any way receive the approval of hon. gentlemen opposite, who represent constituencies in the maritime provinces. I was very much impressed with the speech of the hon. the ex-minister of railways. He travelled all the way from Manhattan Beach to St. Peters' village In Cape Breton. But he in no sense discussed the Intercolonial Railway as a national highway, which should be dear to the hearts of every Canadian,-not merely those who reside in the maritime provinces, but those who reside in the great business centres of Toronto and Montreal and other sections of western Canada. His remarks rather confirmed the rumour that although he had been at one time Minister of Railways, he had never acquired much knowledge about the Intercolonial Railway. There Is a rumour, unfounded perhaps, that when he once did travel over the Intercolonial Railway in his official car, he went to Halifax and returned to Moncton, and there took a breathing spell of about an hour, but did not deign to leave his car to visit the works connected with that railway, although he was Minister of Railways at the time. That rumour may or may not be well founded, but I am sure that in so far as the speech of the hon. gentleman is concerned, it rather confirms the rumour that he did not have much knowledge of the conditions which prevail along the line of that road. You would think when he referred to the winter port of New Brunswick, that he was speaking of Newfoundland. He spoke of it as the city of St. [DOT]Tohn's. He does not even know that it is St. John and not St. John's. His knowledge of that road seems to be very imperfect, and

to have placed him before this committee in the position of one who was rather more interested in some prospectuses in New York than in the proper maintenance and advancement of our great national highway. I have said that the Intercolonial Railway is one of the most splendid assets of Canada, and I shall not attempt to elaborate the point. While I could not show that there has been any accumulation of profits in the treasury of the Dominion, yet I think that the building of that road has created a national spirit and a national life which, but for it, we would not have acquired, and which finds vent, not merely on the floor of parliament, but in the press of the country and on public platforms throughout the land. That national spirit is due to the cementing together of the various sections of Canada by this railway intercommunication. It may be that as this is an asset which cannot be estimated in dollars and cents, some people may regard it as of little value, but I do not view it in that light. And while this road has not given us an accumulation of dollars and cents so far, it seems to me that even in that respect it has a bright future. It seems to me that when the fathers of confederation framed the 145th section of the British North America Act, by which they recognized the fact that it was essential for the consolidation of these provinces that there should be an iron band connecting together the three provinces that then constituted Canada, the idea must have been dominant in their minds that in the future, as our Dominion came into its vast western territory, it was quite as essential that that road should travel beyond the lines of the St. Lawrence and go west, and unite whatever then might be the provinces of the Dominion of Canada.
I am sure those great statesmen, the builders of this confederation, had in mind at that time that it was in the interests of the then three provinces to have them united by such a bond, and would be still more in the interests of the Dominion as it became enlarged, as it extended and became the vast domain which it is to-day. And yet hon. members will complain with respect to the expenditure of the $65,000,000, as it is alleged, that went out of the coffers of this country to construct the Intercolonial Railway. We hear nothing from these hon. gentlemen with respect to the canals of the country. AVe do not hear it in the maritime provinces as a matter of complaint that there have been such large expenditures upon the canals. When a vote is proposed in this House with respect to our canals, you do not find hon. members from the maritime provinces rising in their places to complain. We recognize that the business interests of the Dominion demand that there shall be such means of transportation, we recognize that it is in the interests of not only western Canada but of all Canada that these canals should be maintained. We have 111
invested, as a Dominion, $65,000,000 in the Canadian Pacific Railway, not one rail of which do we owe, not a mile of which do we control-indeed, it controls us rather. I am not complaining with regard to these matters ; but when complaints are made with respect to an investment in our great national highway, and when these complaints are repeated year after year, surely I am justified in making reference to these other expenditures concerning which no complaint has been made. We have a Canadian Pacific, which is not a through line on our Canadian land, but which runs in part through a state of the American Union. We have a Canadian Pacific which, while a credit to Canada, is not in all its parts Canadian. When the British government requires to send its marines or its soldiers across the continent, it is obliged to utilize a portion of the Intercolonial Railway, because it is not permissible for it to send them through American territory over the short line of the Canadian Pacific. So I say that, in all fairness, when we discuss the expenditure on the Intercolonial Railway we should remember the part it has played as a great public work in Canada, we should view it from a higher standpoint than that which has been assumed, I regret to say, by some hon. gentlemen on the other side. I * do not see my hon. friend from Pictou (Mr. Bell) rising in his place to discuss the Intercolonial Railway from this point of view. He lives on the line of the Intercolonial Railway and knows something about it. I assume that my hon. friend from Hamilton (Mr. Barker), who takes such a deep interest in it, has never been over the line of the Intercolonial Railway. I assume that he has never been in the city of Moncton, of which he has heard so much within the last month or so.

I think that Mr. P. S. Archibald came to him rather. Certainly from the speech the hon. gentleman (Mr. Barker) has made and the indications he has given before the Public Accounts Committee of his knowledge of the Intercolonial Railway, one would assume that he had never been over the line of Intercolonial Railway, and knew nothing about it. While he is the critic, and while the ex-Minister of Railways assists him in his carpings against the expenditure on the Intercolonial Railway, do we hear anything from hon. gentlemen like my hon. friend from Pictou, or my hon. friend from King's (Mr. Fowler), or my hon. friend from Sunbury and Queen's (Mr. Wil-mot), or my hon. friend from Charlotte (Mr. Ganong) 1 They must know a great deal more about the Intercolonial Railway, about its circumstances and its workings than do these other hon. gentlemen. But they have not made these complaints. I assume that they are not in sympathy with these



complaints, because they recognize the value of the Intercolonial Railway. They know what it is doing, not merely for the people of the maritime provinces but for the people of all Canada. They recognize that trade and the very heart of trade is centered in that great national highway under government control; and I am sure they would not wish to raise their voices in any attempt to depreciate the Intercolonial Railway as a government road, or tend to cause the people of western Canada to become prejudiced against it or to unite in any way against the maintenance of it as a government road.
Now, I have said that there was a future for the Intercolonial Railway. While the balances have not always been on the right side, yet I take this stand with respect to the matter-that that road was not. constructed as a dividend earning work for this Dominion. I hold that no Minister of Railways is called upon to stand up in this parliament and apologise even if the Intercolonial Railway is not a paying concern in dollars and cents. Its earnings are of a different character, its benefits to the people of the Dominion are not to be measured by mere dollars and cents. It was not built as a commercial road, and I hold, before this committee and before the people of Canada, that there should not be any complaint, even though that road may not show a surplus in earnings. In considering the Intercolonial Railway this committee and the people of Canada must reckon on the future of the maritime provinces.
I am not going to speak at any length with respect to the future of those provinces. In the great province of Nova Scotia there are magnificent industries in the island of Cape Breton, which are speaking in thunder tones to the Dominion of Canada, to the continent of America and to the world, of its great natural resources and its illimitable wealth. More than that. I think the province of New Brunswick has features which will make it a great factor in the support of the Intercolonial Railway and the upbuilding of the Dominion. It must not be supposed that because we have not increased in population we are in any sense going behind. You must bear in mind that while our population has decreased there are many reasons for it. You are spending thousands of dollars yearly of the money of this Dominion in your immigration policy. For the last thirty years, thousands upon thousands have been invested across the water in order to induce people to come to this Dominion. Are their eyes ever directed towards the maritime provinces ? Do the immigration agents, do the transportation companies, ever direct those intending immigrants to these maritime provinces, or instruct them concerning their wealth and resources ? Have we ever had on that immigration staff a man from the maritime provinces to direct the people of the old country to those provinces of this Mr. EMMERSON.
Dominion ? We find that while you have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on immigration, the object has been to direct the people who are seeking a home in the western continent, not to the maritime provinces, not to Quebec or Ontario, but to the wheat fields of the great west. I am not complaining of the efforts which have been put forth to build up our western country, which is worthy of all that can be said in its favour. But we should not forget that we have lands in the maritime provinces which will compare with the prairie lands of the west. I do not wish our immigration agents to forget that in our magnificent marshes of the lower provinces, in the counties of Annapolis, of Colchester, of Hants, of Cumberland, of Westmoreland, of Albert, and of numerous other counties in those vast regions of marsh lands, there is land equal if not superior to the very best prairie lands of the west, land that is inexhaustible in its richness, and land which, if it ever did become exhausted, can easily be renewed through inundations caused by cutting the dykes and allowing the muddy waters of the Bay of Fundy to enrich the soil over which they would flow.
I do not wish to assume the role of a prophet, but I venture to say that the Intercolonial Railway will yet prove to be one of the richest dividend bearing concerns in this great Dominion, that it will one day prove the wisdom of its founders, that it 'will one day justify the Minister of Railways and Canals in his efforts to make this railway worthy of this great Dominion. He found it a tramway and he has left it a railway. He has equipped it in a manner which I need not describe. But there is one thing which has not been mentioned. In mentioning it, I am not speaking upon my own authority, or from any knowledge I possess with respect to it, although I have some such knowledge; but I know the feelings of the business men of Toronto and of Montreal with respect to the establishment of a fast freight service between Montreal and Halifax and Sydney. That is one of the creations of the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals. I was told not many months ago in the city of Toronto, that it was proving of incalculable benefit to the business interests of the west, and that it was contributing to an increase in the business between the -west and the east. This is but one evidence of the value of the efforts which the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals has been putting forth to make a railway out of what seemed to have been the intention, or the result of an intention, to side-track at least a portion of the Intercolonial Railway.
Now, let me say to the members of this committee who are not familiar with the circumstances of the Intercolonial Railway, that there is a great section of it, that portion between St. John and the Sydneys and Halifax, which I suppose is one of the best paying sections of any road in eastern Can-

a da. I believe tliat there are corporations which are turning greedy eyes upon that section of the Intercolonial Railway. It is true that perhaps they might not be so desirous of having what is known as the northern division. It lias been alleged that the hon. gentleman who held the position of Minister of Railways and Canals in a former government, was to make of that a branch line, and that the line between St. John and the Sydneys and Halifax, should be handed over to some one or other of the corporations, with the view of letting them take advantage of the large expenditure which Canada has made on the Intercolonial Railway. I venture to say that if it is not known in this section of Canada, it is at least believed in the eastern section, that the intention in 1890 was that the Intercolonial Railway should cease to be a government road, at least that portion of it which is so desirable between Halifax and the Sydneys and St. John; the intention was that that portion should cease to be a part of the great government' system, and that only that section between Moncton and Levis should be under the control of the Dominion. It is true that that portion of the road, the northern division, goes through a great stretch of country, but not an unimportant section; it taps a splendid country, splendid in its lumber resources, splendid in its wealth of fisheries; but yet as it travels around the shores of the St. Lawrence it deviates so far from the straight line that its maintenance is rather expensive. But that it is an essential feature for that section of the country, that it is an essential feature for the Dominion, I am prepared to maintain before this committee and the people of this country.
Now, Mr. Chairman, that is believed to have been the intention of those who were charged with the responsibility of governing this country at that time; and I am led to believe by the tone of the speech of the hon. member for South Lanark (Mr. Haggart) that there still remains in his mind a lingering intention of attaining that object by contributing in some manner towards prejudicing the Intercolonial Railway in the minds of the people, in order that, if ever an opportunity should occur, the idea at which I have hinted might be carried out. I do not think that, in justice to the Dominion as a whole, without regard to any sectionalism, without regard to the people of my own province nor of any other province-I do not think it would be in the interest of any section of Canada that any such arrangements should take place. It would be unfair, unjust, and it would be a breach of the terms of confederation. If the terms of confederation are to be carried out in their entirety, that the Intercolonial Railway shall be extended, it shall craw-1 further west year after year until possibly it shall extend to the graneries of the west and our seaports shall be the ports whence sail the rich products of the great 111*
western country. We hear much from hon. members who represent the western constituencies complaining of the exorbitant freight charges of the railway companies in the west. Complaint after complaint has been made, not merely in this House, but before the committees of this House. If there is to be a remedy applied, one that will be apt and effective, that remedy will be found in the extension of the government system of railways into that western country, so that the government may control freight rates in the west in the' same way as it now controls freight rates in the eastern section of Canada.
The hon. member for South Lanark (Mr. Haggart) has spoken of the expenditure made in the city of St. John, and he has termed it a sink hole. I think these were elegant words of the hon. gentleman. The hon. member for Hamilton (Mr. Barker) referred to the purchase of some marsh land within the city limits of St. John at the rate of $475 per acre. I want to know how far my hon. friends from the province of New Brunswick, having a knowledge of the completion of the terminal facilities at St. John, are prepared to say ' hear, hear ' to the remarks of the hon. member for South Lanark ? I take the hon. member for King's, N.B. (Mr. Fowler), who is in my eye at the present moment, and I am sure that he would not say ' hear, hear ' to any expression of the kind in respect to the expenditure made at the city of St. John. I think the complaint was that there was an expenditure of $225,000 in connection with the wharf and freight shed. Let me tell the hon. gentleman (Mr. Haggart) that a portion of the money was expended in renewing the building and perfecting the foundations of the station, in the city of St. John built by the hon. gentleman himself when he was in office, and which foundations were so imperfect that if they had not been repaired, and if this money had not been expended, the station-house would have tumbled to the ground. Let me tell him that if be and the hon. member for Hamilton complain of the payment of $475 per acre for marsh lands within the city limits of St. John, near the round house of the railway, if they feel badly, if their feelings are harrowed in respect to that, the only solace I can offer is to refer them to the public accounts of a few years ago when they bought the Harris property in the city of St. John at $1 per foot, and paid $200,000 for 200,000 feet. Then, they did not use it. My hon. friend has complained of the fact that there has been charged to capital account on the Intercolonial Railway a sufficient sum of money for the extension of the yards\ within the city limits of St. John, near the round house of the terminal facilities there. He has complained that the material, although charged against capital account and although set aside and assigned for this purpose, is not on the ground. Let me remind my hon. friend

of one fact that was disclosed before the committee, which he has apparently forgotten, that this has been the system which has prevailed along the line of the Intercolonial Railway since it has been the Intercolonial Railway. Let me remind him of the fact that Mr. Fottinger, in giving his evidence before the Public Accounts Committee, stated that that was the very course followed when the St. Charles branch was built in the province of Quebec. The hon. gentleman did not complain then. He did not tell this committee that that was a custom which had prevailed in the bookkeeping of the Intercolonial Railway as far back as the time of the construction of the St. Charles branch and that it has been continued from that time down to the present, not merely under this government, or under the regime of the Minister of Railway and Canals (Hon. Mr. Blair), but under the regime of the hon. gentleman (Mr. Haggart). Yet, he made much ado in respect to the fact. The expenditure, he said, was charged to capital account in the city of St. John, and he complained that it had been done in 1900, and that the material was still unused. I want to remind my hon. friend, if lie wants something to weep over, that although the Harris property was purchased years ago for the sum which I have named, it remained idle year after year and year after year, and it was never utilized, except by the boys for playing base ball and cricket and ad an athletic ground, for any purpose in connection with the Intercolonial Railway, until the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals attempted to make the port of St. John what it is, and not until he attempted to complete the terminal facilities there was this property utilized.

I want also to remind my hon. friend (Mr. Barker), who made a complaint in respect to the purchase of this marsh land at $475 per acre, that the property was owned by the Gilbert family and if he knows anything about the politics of that country he will know that these gentlemen were Conservatives.

Had the hon. gentleman taken the pains to learn the fact, he would have known that when it was sought to purchase that property by the Athletic Association of St. John, they could not purchase It for less than $1,250 per acre ? Yet, the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals was enabled to purchase it at $475 per acre.
And now, Mr. Chairman, there has been considerable reference made to the production of a letter before the Public Accounts Committee. I believe that last evening when I happened to be out of the chamber for a moment, a very courteous remark was made by the hon. member for East Elgin (Mr. Ingram) with respect to myself, and at that moment, if I am informed correctly, some hon. member from one of the Ontario constituencies interjected the remark :	That is a specimen of New Brunswick politics. I want to tell my hon. friends the Tory members from the province of Ontario, that if I wish for and need to take lessons In political morals or political ethics I will not go to them. I did produce a letter, and I have recited to the committee and it is part of the records of this House, the circumstances under which I secured that letter. I did not go to any spittoon and pick out the pieces and have them pasted together as was done by the Tory party some years ago in the province of Ontario in connection with a letter of the Hon. Edward Blake. I am quite sure that if any reflections are to be indulged in in connection with the production of the letter, the reflections should be upon the hon. member from Hamilton (Mr. Barker). I have told that when I went to Moncton I learned with respect to this letter ; I secured the letter in the way which I have detailed, and I produced the letter before the committee, and that is what troubles the hon. member from Hamilton. That is the difficulty with him. I think, Sir, that the scene in the Public Accounts Committee when my hon. friend was examining the witness in respect to the letter-at which time my courtesy forbade me from interfering in his examination-I think, Sir. that that scene should have been the subject of the photographers art. The picture of my hon. friend from Hamilton (Mr. Barker) would have been a study, and as for my hon., my restless friend from South Lanark (Mr. Haggart) why, if I could describe him as he appeared to be at that moment this committee would revel in the description. I might perhaps indulge in a simile and say. that he looked very much like a hen that had been disturbed off her nest. Here was a witness who had stated that he had received a letter from the Minister of Railways and Canals, and he thought that the words of that letter were to tell him to

accept certain railway ties, and the bon. member from Hamilton (Mr. Barker) was pressing the witness with the question : Yes, the letter told you to take or accept these ties. The witness not having In mind clearly the exact terms of the letter did not know exactly, but he thought that was it. My bon. friends opposite in their anticipation, expecting to go before the country with a grievance, knowing that they had utterly failed in their exploring expedition before the Public Accounts Committee, knowing that they had utterly failed in respect to finding anything that would in any way besmirch the Minister of Railways and Canals, thought to themselves : Oh, here_is something we can appeal to the country upon ; the Minister of Railways and Canals has written this letter and it is not forthcoming. But unfortunately for them I had taken the precaution to secure that letter.

My hon. friend (Mr. Barker.) has been kind enough to make a personal reference to myself in connection with the Minister of Railways and Canals (Hon. Mr. Blair). He said-I do not quote his exact words-that it was rumoured that the Minister of Railways and Canals (Hon. Mr. Blair) and the member for Westmoreland (Mr. Emmerson) were not on the best of terms.

I do not belong to any nest of traitors. I have never been associated in any system of brigandage, political or otherwise. I have never gone into a constituency and had an ex-colleague of mine, a gentleman who was my premier come into the county and canvass against me and refer to me in terms that were certainly anything but complimentary. I have never been placed in any such position. I can say that as regards the Minister of Railways and Canals and myself, in so far as our personal relations are concerned they have always been of the most amicable and friendly character, even during this session from the very commencement of it down to the present day. But
let me say this : I have not always agreed with the Minister of Railways and Canals with respect to the management of the Intercolonial Railway. I have not hesitated to tell the hon. minister in private, and I am not ashamed to say it before this committee and before the country, that in respect to the management of the Intercolonial Railway I have not been in accord with him. These gentlemen opposite call it a political road, and well may they call it that; but, it is not a political road in the interests of the Liberal party. The complaint that has been made-and the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals knows it-is, that the management of the Intercolonial Railway during the past six years in so far as its details and its officials are concerned, has been identical with that which prevailed prior to 1896. And while the Minister of Railways and Canals has stated before this House that he has given the utmost freedom to the employees of that road in respect to their voting. I want to tell him that his officers, and that his bosses, and that his foremen have not been so generous. I want to tell the minister that in many instances there have been good Liberal votes sacrificed, not in the interest of that fairness of which he has been an apostle, but of which his officials and his foremen have not always been apostles by any means. I have not seen eye to eye with the minister. I have felt on occasions that there had been men placed in the employ of the Intercolonial Railway who should not be there, and I have so told the minister. I have felt that these men were there to the exclusion of many competent men in our ranks, and of our own country, but, Sir, that has in no sense interfered with the relationship between the minister and myself. I hold these views, and I am an apostle of the idea that the minister should be surrounded by men who are in sympathy, by men who are not seeking to make the Liberal party dissatisfied with the management of the Intercolonial Railway, by men who are not seeking to create dissensions in the ranks of the Liberal party. I have been an apostle of the idea that the minister should be surrounded by men who are in sympathy not only with him but with the government which he represents. I tell the hon. minister that while it may be true-and it is preached on the other side of the House to-day, though it was not preached a few years ago-that there should be a generous treatment of the employees of the road, while they should be given the greatest latitude possible, while their manhood should not be stunted or suppressed in any way, yet I feel that they should not take advantage of that generosity. While they are not called upon to refrain from casting their votes in favour of the Conservative party, if they so wish, they should not be placed in a position where they- can

coerce a Liberal voter in the exercise of his franchise.
With regard to the personal reference made to myself in that connection by my hon. friend from Hamilton (Mr. Barker), I want to tell him that that is the sum total of my complaint. The insinuation which my hon. friend threw out in his speech last night must have been, I am sure, from my observation of the hon. gentleman, unintentional; but if he harboured any suspicion that I could in any way be identified with those who belonged to the nest of traitors, or could in any way strike below the belt, I want him to disabuse his mind of any such idea. I produced the letter, because it came honourably into my hands, it came honourably into the hands of the gentleman who gave it to me, and I gave it honourably into the hands of the committee. The country has the benefit of it-that is what my hon. friend complains of-and the country having the benefit of it, the whole evidence is there, and the hon. Minister of Railways is exonerated freely and fully in respect to the matter.

I do not know Mr. EMMERSON.
who expressed the most disgust, my hon. friend from Hamilton or the gentleman to whom I refer. It is rumoured-if we want to indulge in rumours-that before they bade each other good-bye, they exchanged compliments of a not very complimentary character. But whatever may have transpired, I shall not place upon ' Hansard ' the rumours I heard, though I have no doubt they would be quite as interesting as the prospectus which was placed on ' Hansard ' as a matter of record last evening. While an attempt is being made to draw a herring across the trail with respect to this letter, I wonder if my attitude with respect to it was any less dignified than was the attitude of the hon. ex-Minister of Railways with respect to Mr. P. S. Archibald. Mr. Archibald, it will be remembered, is the hero of the shingle story, which I think is a part of the record of this House; certainly it was placed on the Table of the House. The story is that once there was a very interesting episode in the history of the Intercolonial Railway; that it was on the eve of the general election of 1S9G: that railway passes, which were made up in book form, were sent out by emissaries to various stations along the line of the Intercolonial Railway, from Lfivis to the Sydneys, and distributed free gratis, so that all who ran might read, and they could travel by the Intercolonial Railway without charge; that the telegrams kept coming in. ' Send me twenty-five thousand more shingles.' and so on; that although the supply had been very generous in the first instance, it had run out. and more and more came the cry of the horse-leech for these passes. Mr. Archibald was dismissed from the Intercolonial Railway, and I have no doubt that that gentleman is not very amiably disposed towards the hon. Minister of Railways. I did not think he would be a witness before the Public Accounts Committee of this House, because I remember an occasion in the legislature of New Brunswick, when there was a committee investigating a matter which had originated in the brain of Mr. P. S. Archibald, after his dismissal from the Intercolonial Railway, and when that gentleman, at the expense of the country, was brought to Fredericton, and was kept there week after week on the expectation that he would give his evidence as the originator of the story; but just before it was necessary to call him, he disappeared into thin air, and the people of Fredericton have not laid eyes on him to this day. It occurred to me, therefore, that possibly that gentleman might have found his way to Ottawa thinking there would not be any inquiry into thet subject of ties or any necessity for producing that letter. Therefore I did not rush to the committee at once and announce the letter. I produced it in all good time, unfortunately for the member for Hamilton. The hon. member for South Lanark (Mr. Haggart) has made reference to a gentleman holding a very responsible position"" a gentle-
naan well and favorably known throughout the province of. New Brunswick, one of the ablest lawyers, as I believe, in this Dominion, a gentleman who holds the position of Attorney General of the province of New Brunswick. the Hon. William Pugsley. The member for South Lanark (Mr. Haggart) made reference on a former occasion to the Hon. Mr. Pugsley in terms that were at least intended to be slighting, and for which he was afterwards called upon to make amends and I believe did apologize. On this occasion he could not pass by a discussion of the Intercolonial Railway and its administration by the Minister of Railways without indulging in a reflection upon the Hon. Mr. Pugsley. He told us that Mr. Pugsley had been recently in New York in company with the Minister of Railways.

I would not have brought the matter up were it not alleged that these parties had purchased the Canada Atlantic Railway, which they say is part and parcel of their scheme. Mr. Webb has published the statement in the papers that he has bought the Adirondack Railway, and that its stock has advanced from 40 to 106 or 107, and that the stock of this Dominion Securities Company, which has not an asset in the world except the contracts or agreements which they professed to have made with the Dominion government, and the possibility of arranging this grand scheme with the province of Nova Scotia, has been selling up to 5 or 7 per cent premium.

But I want to invite the attention of the committee for a moment to the evident desire and attempt of the hon. member for Hamilton (Mr. Barker), to show that all these tie transactions and coal purchases were made during the election of 1900. Of course he could not bring any evidence to show that there was any wrong-doing or to show even suspicious circumstances, but he evidently desired to have it go to the country that these purchases were made In contemplation of and in connection with the Dominion elections. Innuendos and insinuations were the weapons which my hon. friend used. Having no evidence of any fact, he had to resort to these miserable tactics. He made a reference to Mr. Curran, but, as was shown before tbe committee, Mr. Curran is tbe foreman of the Sumner Company, which is presided over by one of the leading lights of the Conservative party in New Brunswick, and which carries on a very large business, not only at Moncton, but at Bathurst, and Mr. Curran is the general manager of that concern at the town of Bathurst, in the county of Gloucester. My hon. friend threw out the suggestion that Mr. Curran was in some way connected with the government, as the treasurer of the Liberal organization in that section of the province, but I am sure that my hon. friend has no facts upon which to base even a suspicion of that kind. I am sure that he has not been well advised, that he has not been well coached, and there seems to have been a failure of connection with respect to that information in the same way that there was with respect to a great

deal of tlie information that came from Sackville to my hon. friend from Hamilton. If my hon. friend will refer to the evidence before the committee, he will find that the contract with Mr. Curran was not entered Into until some months after the elections took place. He will find that there was no business transaction between Mr. Curran and the Intercolonial Railway until about January, 1901, and then that it was based upon a tender which Mr. Curran had put in for the supply of ties. And yet my hon. friend will have the country believe that this was an election transaction, and that there must be something wrong connected with it because it took place during the election year. My hon. friend has no evidence other than his suspicions, and I do not think, however, much he might wish to mislead the committee that this kind of evidence would enable him to do so. But I am sure he would not desire to mislead the committee

What I have just said was true also with regard to the coal transaction. I am sure the evidence with respect to the purchase of coal was clear, convincing. The purchase was made at a time when a strike was believed to be imminent in the collieries In Nova Scotia. I know that it was a matter of common knowledge at that time that such a strike was feared to be pending. It was referred to in the press day after day. Notice was given by the men to the managers; there were disputes, there were threatenings. As Mr. Pottinger stated, there was, at that time, a great lessening of the supply of coal below what it was usual for the Intercolonial Railway to carry. Had there been such a strike, had it been impossible to acquire from the collieries of Nova Scotia the necessary coal, and had the railway been obliged to stop its traffic for want of coal, what a cry would have been raised from one end of the country to the other, as to the incompetency and incapacity of the Minister of Railways. I do think my hon. friend has strained the point, that he has endeavoured to mislead when he says this coal was purchased during an election year. Why, the coal was not even purchased during an election year, but during the year succeeding the general election of 1900.
Now, I do think the discussion with respect to the Intercolonial Railway should be based upon the value of the Intercolonial Railway to the country, its condition in relation to the work it is doing, and keeping in mind the work it has done for this Dominion. I trust this spirit will prevail. I trust there will be no attempt on the part of those in the west to create a prejudice against the maritime provinces or to seek to give the impression that this road is Mr. EMMERSON.

My authority is information given by an officer of the Dominion Securities Company. It says :
From the information- which I obtained from an officer of the concern- it appears that the Dominion Securities Company, was originally formed as a blind pool by Messrs. Seward Webb, Callaway and Van Etten. At that time Mr Callaway was president of the New York Central, while Mr. Van Etten occupied a somewhat similar position- on the Boston and Albany. In the early part of last year the company was organized under the laws of New Jersey. Mr. Webb was attracted to Nova Scotia by the development going on at Sydney, C.B., and, having become acquainted with certain friends of (he Minister of Railways at Ottawa, was assured by them that there was nothing to hinder him from gettiDg possession- of the Intercolonial Railway. Negotiations were carried on between Mr. Webb and his friends on the one hand and Hon. William Pugsiey on the other. In the end, however, the Minister of Railways himself visited New York and made it plain- to Mr. Webb and his friends that it was clean out of the

question for them to acquire the Intercolonial at any rate, under existing conditions.
I mentioned to the credit of the minister last night that that was my information on the subject.

As said above they have no intention of building to St. John. They are out to acquire, if possible, the South Shore contract promised to Mr. William Mackenzie, which, together with their contract in Cape Breton, would afford them, they imagine, the means of getting the control of the Intercolonial Railway.
This, of course, is hearsay.
My impression is they have been seriously mislead by Mr. Pugsley and are buoyed up by expectations not likely to be realized, so far, at least, as the acquisition of the Intercolonial Railway is concerned.

Mr. HAGGART.,,SUPPLY-ATLANTIC SHIPPING COMBINE.,WILLIAM PUGSLEY.,,"In speaking upon the subject I mentioned no letter, no information that I had received further than this, that it was rumoured in New York city that negotiations were going on for the purpose of selling the Intercolonial Railway. The hon. minister in his speech today said I had no authority to say so, and Mr. Pugsley, after reading my remarks in the ' Hansard,' gave an explicit denial to the rumour. For the purpose of justifying the statement that I made yesterday, I said I made it pro tanto, for as much as it was worth, and I read an extract from

a letter I had received. The hon. gentleman says it is no justification at all unless I give the man's name. All 1 have to say is that, on the authority of statements that were made to me, I firmly believed, when I made the statement, that such negotiations were going on. I was attacked by the hon. member for Westmoreland on the strength of the statement that Mr. Pugsley entirely denied it. Then, the justification for the statement I made was a private letter to myself, which I have not the authority to use, but I shall ask the party's permission. There are other matters contained in the letter which I would not like to make public, but I shall ask the party's permission to make use of this particular portion of the letter, and if I get authority I will read it to the House. If I do not get authority I will say so candidly and withdraw the statement.
Mr. BORDEN (Halifax. The right hon. leader of the House is very much more sensitive over matters of this kind than I have seen him on previous occasions. I recall the occasion in this House, not many years ago, when the right hon. gentleman brought a telegram down from across the Atlantic denying that Mr. Hamilton-Smythe was an authorized agent of the Rothschilds. But, before that telegram was read to the House, it was rumoured the right hon. gentleman sent his secretary around to the Liberal press of this country for the purpose of making it public. I was present when the right hon. gentleman said, in answer to a question by Sir Charles Tupper who was then leading the opposition, that he would bring down to this House the telegram to which that was an answer, and I was also present on the following day when the right hon. gentleman came down to this House and said he would not bring it down because it was a private telegram. He produced in the House and distributed through the press a telegram for the purpose of discrediting Mr. Hamilton Smythe who had come forward with a better contract in respect to the Yukon railway than that which the government were attempting to put through the House. That was a public telegram, it was read to the House, it was sent to the press of the country, but the telegram which the right hon. gentleman sent across the Atlantic and which had produced that one, was, according to the right hon. gentleman, a private telegram. The Prime Minister, I think is not perfectly logical or perfectly consistent. He is very much more sensitive now than he was then. An hon. gentleman made certain statements in this debate. He said that there were rumours in New York which should be brought to the attention of the government. He was challenged for his authority and he said that he would give his authority.. He read a statement which he says had been communicated to him in an interview with an officer
of the Dominion Securities Company. The right hon. leader of the House says that corporations cannot act except by agents.
I never understood that it was absolutely necessary in order to bind a corporation that you should have the name of the agent. Has the right hon. gentleman always been provided with the names of agents when he has been dealing with corporations in this House ? I do not think so. It is perfectly patent that although Mr. Pugsley denies that he ever had any negotiations with any officer of the Dominion Securities Company, that he can make all the denial in this case that he could make if the name were given to him and if Mr. Pugsley wishes to make a denial, then, it is a question of veracity between the informant of my hon. friend (Mr. Haggart) and Mr. Pugsley.

Any one of us may some day be in, the same position. I do not think that any hon. member should make statements about another hon. member in the House, upon mere New York street rumour or upon a rumour that is obtained upon the curbstone, or in any offices of the brokers in New York, or in any office in New York. I think that the hon. member for South Lanark (Mr. Haggart) made a mistake, and I think there is no hon. gentleman in the House who feels it more than he does. The case mentioned by the hon. leader of the opposition (Mr. Borden, Halifax) was a different case altogether. The position there was of a telegram sent. Nobody has asked the hon. member for South Lanark to produce the letter he wrote to this man asking him for this information. All that this committee has anything to do with is with the

letter that he received and upon which letter he made the statement. Nobody cares about any other statements that may be contained in the letter which he received. Evidently the hon. gentleman wrote about a great many things. We have nothing to do with that letter and we have nothing to do with anything except the direct statement that the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals (Mr. Blair) and Mr. Pugsley were concerned in discussing this matter in some way. Mr. Pugsley could not speak except with the authority of the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals. Mr. Pugsley had no power to go to Mr. Meyer and discuss this matter with him. The hon. Minister of Railways and Canals was mentioned as going to New York in regard to this matter, and he was quoted as saying that he did not see his way clear to make this arrangement. That is a statement of the most damaging kind. It is a damaging statement to say that the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals would ever think of discussing the question of the transferrence of the Intercolonial Railway. Does the hon. -member for South Lanark, or does the hon. leader of the opposition (Mr. Borden, Halifax) think it fair, upon a New York rumour, upon a letter from a man whose name will not be given, to say that the Minister of Railways and Canals and Mr. Pugsley are talking about handing over this heritage of Canada to a lot of Yankee speculators ? This is not a trifling matter. It is not a trifling matter to say : We think the Minister of Railways and Canals should be looked after, that he is quietly going to work to hand over the Intercolonial Railway. The people in the maritime provinces believe that the Intercolonial Railway will not only become an admirable asset but a valuable road, and we must still have our own road in our own interest as well as in the interests of the people of Canada. I think the name should be given for these two reasons : The name should be given, in the first place, so that we may know the man who made this lying statement, and in the second place, the name should be given so that no member of this House may lightly charge a member on the other side and when challenged attempt to back it up by saying that it was rumoured in New York. Surely that is anything but fair. I think the hon. gentleman should rise in his place now and manfully say : Well, I heard it from so and so. The minister says it is not so, Mr. Pugsley says it is not so, I take it back and the man wno signed this paper was wrong. He might have heard this, but I apologize to the House for making such a statement as I did upon evidence of such a character.

The hon. member for Lanark did this. He said :	That the
Minister of Railways and his friends were trying to negotiate the sale of the Intercolonial Railway at the present time in New York; and he exclaimed :	Is it under the
auspices of the Dominion Securities Company that this extension of the Intercolonial Railway is going to be made to the west ?

convey that impression, or if not, why did he use the language ? If he did intend to convey the impression, why did he not take the responsibility upon himself as a member which he ought to take ?

He tells us that he does not make anything which resembles or is intended to be a charge, or an insinuation, or a reflection on anybody, but the hon. gentleman's words do not bear out that statement. He was reading these prospectuses and he went on to speak about what is taking place between this syndicate and others, and I rose in my place and I said ;
Where is the relevancy of all this.
I could not for the life of me see why a member of this House who knew as much as the hon. gentleman (Mr. Haggart) ought to know, and who is as responsible as he is actually, and as he ought to hold himself before the House-I could not see why he should incumber ' Hansard ' with reading over all this absurd and ridiculous prospectus-fraudulent if you like to call it so, and you would be justified in so describing it- I could not see why he should drag this in; I could not see why he should drag in the government; drag in the Minister of Railways; drag in Mr. Pugsley and endeavour to create the impression that there was something that had not been probed, and

which if it were probed, would reflect upon the minister. So X asked the hon. gentleman :
Where is the relevancy of all this.
And what did the hon. gentleman reply ? He said :
I want to show the whole connection-
The House will remember what the hon. gentleman said a few moments ago, and here is the record which corresponds exactly with my recollection of what the hon. gentleman did say. He replied :
I want to show that the hon. gentleman (that is the Minister of Railways) has been down in New York in reference to this negotiation, and that he had his agents in New York.
Mark the words :
That he had has agents in New York negotiating for the sale of the Intercolonial Railway -Mr. Pugsley and others it is so reported were down there.
Now, what is all that intended to convey to any mind of ordinary intelligence which can understand the meaning of plain words ? What it is intended to convey ? Is it not, that I was engaged in what I would consider a most reprehensible, a most unworthy and a most improper act holding the position which I do-to be privately associated with a syndicate, and having agents employed with a view to effecting a sale of the Intercolonial Railway. The thing has only one redeeming feature, that is, that it is so utterly and ridiculously silly that I should scarcely feel justified in referring to it, only that in coming to that conclusion I should undoubtedly have to assign to my hon. friend a range of intellect which I have not any desire or thought of doing. What does my hon. friend mean by it ? The meaning is too clear to need any explanation or interpretation, it speaks for itself-it means to cast a reproach on me as the minister of the department. My hon. friend having undertaken to do that in these explicit terms, I say that, if he acts in a manner becoming to a member of this parliament, in addition to the fact that he has promised to give his authority, it is his bounden duty to give that authority here and now, or to withdraw the statements which he has made and apologize for the imputations which he has cast.

As the hon. gentleman seems to be sensitive on this subject, I would like to point out one or twro facts which it would be well for him to bear in memory. I dare say he recollects the statement of his leader in this House on one occasion that no man would be dismissed for political partisanship without being afforded an opportunity to make out his case by an investigation. The hon. gentleman does not seem to be disturbed in his mind that that promise has not been carried out. Would it not be well for that sensitive spirit of his to consider that feature of the case which has been going on for the last four or five years ? Let him explain to the House why that particular circumstance does not trouble his mind to the same extent as the failure of my hon. friend from South Lanark (Mr. Haggart) to give the name of a certain officer of this company. I think the hon. gentleman has been in this House when charges of the grossest possible fraud have been made during the present session against people who did work for this country in 1891, without any opportunity whatever having been afforded to those men to meet these charges, without their being even acquainted with those charges when made in the House first by the Minister of Trade and Commerce (Sir Richard Cartwright) and afterwards by the Minister of Agriculture (Hon.

I would like to know how it is that the hon. gentleman has so much to say about this particular feature and nothing about that. I would also point out to my hon. friend that we have had officials dismissed over and over again, on charges of political partisanship, and when we have asked in this House for the grounds of their dismissal we have been told that the charges have been substantiated in such a way that the particular department concerned was perfectly satisfied, and took the whole responsibility, while the men who were so dismissed did not, in some instances at least, even know the names of the persons who made the charges against them, and, notwithstanding the promise of the leader of the House, were not given the slightest opportunity for any investigation. My hon. friend himself has not always been so careful of these matters as he would have us believe. And I recollect, on one occasion some three or four years ago, when the hon. minister's own estimates were under discussion, we had to sit in this House a very long time indeed because he was not willing to fulfill the promise he had made to give certain information. The hon. gentleman could have saved this House a great deal of trouble on that occasion if he had been as scrupulous and sensitive on this subject as he seems to be to-night.
I do not wish to detain the House at any length with regard to this matter. My hon. friend from South Lanark (Mr. Hag-gart) has told the House the source of his information. True, he has not given the name of the particular officer, but only the name of the company from which that information was received.

There was a claim before the department. A tried official of the hon. gentleman's department went to Quebec to bring about the purchase of a very considerable portion of land.

He reported to the minister that this was a fair price, and the minister consequently initialled the document and agreed to allow that. But in the month of November, 1898, the parties concerned got information that they had better not accept that price and the matter dragged on. Year followed year, and finally, three years after, the parties concerned-or one of them at least-not being satisfied with the price offered by the minister, and which was said by the Minister of Justice and the late Mr. Dobell, who Mr. BENNETT.
was then a member of the cabinet, to be a fair one, was advised-I do not suppose he came to that decision by intuition-to go to New Brunswick and hunt up a solicitor. He had had a solicitor employed, a member of this House, whose name I need not mention now because it is not pertinent to the issue. But there was a member of this House who laid down the principle last year that he had a perfect right to take advantage of his position, as member, to go into the department and press claims on behalf of clients. There never was a time in the history of the country when that practice obtained to the extent it does today. It is notorious, particularly in Ontario, that such is the practice to-day.

I do not know, but I presume that Mr. Archer, who is a resident of Montreal, and not of Quebec, as the hon. gentleman stated, would be very likely to come into contact with so prominent a lawyer as Mr. Pugsley.

He referred to the expression upou the countenance of the member for Hamilton (Mr. Barker) when this famous letter was produced by the member for AVest-moreland. Sir, I have in my mind a scene which I think would be still more worthy the art of the photographer. Some months ago, and up to the beginning of this session of parliament, we heard in New Brunswick very strong rumours of the belligerent attitude which the hon. member for AVest-moreland had assumed towards the Minister of Railways and Canals. The member for AVestmoreland is a gentleman of a somewhat impulsive nature, and' when he feels that he has a grievance he does not make any bones, as we say, in giving utterance to his feelings; and he gave very strong utterance to his feelings in his native county and throughout the province. It was a matter notorious and patent to everybody that very strained relations existed between the member for Westmoreland and the Minister of Railways and Canals. The member for Westmoreland came to this parliament with the same feeling of rancour, the same feeling of resentment in his heart towards the Minister of Railways and Canals concerning his management of the Intercolonial Railway. But, Sir, after he arrived here a change came over the spirit of his dreams, and he became disarmed; and the scene I would like to see properly portrayed was the scene when the two met and a reconciliation took place.

tears streaming from liis eyes, be embraced tbe Minister of Railways and Canals and said to him : ' I have been deceived, I have been tricked, I have been cajoled by you, X have been induced to give up tbe position of premier of the province of New Brunswick by means of a glittering promise you made to me if I would take part in federal politics, and when I gave up the position I held in my native; province, and came into the federal arena, I found you did not, or could not, deliver the goods, and naturally I was cross and angry with you. But I have in my mind the memory of those twenty-five years of close intimacy and companionship-which the hon. gentleman told us about this afternoon-and for the sake of the memory of those years of friendship I am prepared to forgive you. And the minister, not to be outdone in generosity by the member for Westmoreland, said :	' Henry, I am willing to be forgiven.'
Now, Sir, the member for Westmoreland, in his peroration, grew very eloquent on the subject of broad statesmanship and he said to hon. members on this side of the House :
' You must give up this petty parish politics, you must be broad in your statesmanship, you must view this Intercolonial Railway in a broad and statesmanlike manner. Very good advice, excellent precepts, and I would that the example of the member for Westmoreland accorded better with his precepts. What he said to this House and country- and judging from the loud tones in which he spoke, if the windows had been open it would not have been necessary for the members of the press to have recorded his speech, because the country would have heard it-he said he was prepared to tell this House and the country that he was not altogether in accord with the policy of the minister in the management of his department. Sir, we expected him to give the reasons why he was not in accord, we expected to hear a discussion of the railway policy of the minister; we expected to be told on what particular he disagreed with him. What did we hear ? Was it something on broad lines of statesmanship in which he disagreed with the minister ? No, Sir, it was solely and entirely because, as he said, the minister had not introduced enough politics into the management of the Intercolonial Railway. And this is the sort of statesmanship we get from the hon. member for Westmoreland, the man who occupied the proud position of premier of the province of New Brunswick. We should expect something wider, something broader from the hon. gentleman than, that sort of doctrine. I failed to understand what fault he could find with the minister on that ground. I thought that in no department of the public service had so many men been displaced for political reasons as on the Intercolonial Railway, I won't except even the Post Office Department, and that was bad enough, in all conscience. The 1121
hon. gentleman had denounced what he termed the hydra-headed mismanagement of the Intercolonial Railway-those were the very words he is said to have used in characterizing the management of the Intercolonial Railway by the Minister of Railways and Canals. And the only fault that he now tells the House he has to find, is because the minister has not dismissed enough officials, that they are allowed to vote as they please And the minister, as I understand, though I was not in the House at the time, stood up in his place and said that there was no coercion used towards the employees of the Intercolonial Railway. Sir, along -the line of the Intercolonial Railway people will laugh at that statement of the Minister of Railways and Canals when they read it. The Intercolonial Railway runs through the county which I have the honour to represent in this House, for a distance of sixty miles, and upon nearly every official of that road coercion was brought in the last election; not satisfied with that, they even resort to it in connection with municipal and local politics, and 'in the very last election run in the county of King's a few weeks ago, that same coercion was brought to bear upon employees of the Intercolonial Railway.

PUGSLEY.,,"I rose before the item which was under discussion by the hon. member for Westmoreland was carried. I rose several times to speak while that little side discussion was going on, ""but I was so unfortunate as not to be able to get the Chairman's eye. It seems to me that the hon. member for Westmoreland, in his desire to show to the committee and the country that there had been brought about, between himself and the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals, a reconciliation, should have made some defence of the railway policy of the hon. minister when that item was under discussion. It seems to me that he should have endeavoured to have made some reply

to the most convincing speech that was made by the hon. member for Hamilton (Mr. Barker) in connection with the mismanagement of the Intercolonial Railway, a speech the most argumentative, the most logical, of any speech that I ever remember listening to since I have been a member of this House, a speech which was most convincing in its arguments and a speech which showed that there had been the grossest mismanagement on the part of the hon. minister in connection with his department. Yet, the hon. member for Westmoreland, who comes from the railway centre of New Brunswick, was unable-we must presume he was unable, because he did not avail himself of the opportunity-to reply to a single one of the charges that were made against the management of the Intercolonial Railway. There was the question of the tie scandal; he might have shown, if he could, the necessity of purchasing 1,300,000 ties when the department required only 300,000 or 400,000, he might have shown why it was that they purchased ties whose life is only three or four years when they might have had the other kind. He knew that it was impossible to defend such a scandalous thing ns that. But, the hon. gentleman had to make a defence in his own behalf in connection with the tie scandal. He had to defend his conduct, or to attempt to defend it, in obtaining possession of this celebrated letter which was written in pencil by the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals to the tie inspector. He found it necessary to make some defence as to that. The hon. gentleman is a lawyer, but I do not think, were he defending a man who was charged with being the receiver of stolen goods, and he made such a lame defence as he did in this case, that he could expect any common sense, intelligent jury to acquit the man. He admits the whole thing. What a spectacle have w7e in this House of Commons ? An hon. gentleman who is the representative of one of the largest constituencies in tne Dominion of Canada and one of the most intelligent constituencies gets up in his place in the House of Commons, in the parliament of Canada, and admits that he is a receiver of stolen goods-admits more, admits that he is an accessory before the fact of the theft of these goods that this man McManus was acting under his direction, and acting at his request when he went to his brother's desk and abstracted this letter. What defence can there be for that ? Hon. gentlemen on the other side of the House may say-oh, he was his brother and therefore it is no harm. Does it make it any less a theft because one brother takes from the property of the other ? Has the hon. gentleman never heard of one brother murdering another brother ; of a son murdering a father ? Why, to-day there is in one of the jails of this province a man charged with the murder of his father. It is a crime just as much as
though it was the murder of a stranger; aye, the relationship makes the offence the greater. And here is the hon. member for Westmoreland (Mr. Bmmerson), who admits that by his direction this man stole this letter, and that he took the letter from this man knowing it to have been stolen. That is the whole case in a nutshell. And how does the hon. gentleman (Mr. Emmerson) defend himself ? He says : I did not find the letter in a spittoon and piece it together. That is the only defence he can offer to the House and to the country for his conduct. Why, Mr. Chairman, as a matter of law, and he is lawyer enough to know it, whatever the moral offence may be, he could not be tried and convicted for finding the letter in a spittoon and piecing it together, but he could for the other offence.
The hon. gentleman (Mr. Emmerson) made an attempt to justify the purchase of these ties by saying they were not all purchased before the elections. What a defence that is. If they were not purchased before the election, how easy a matter it is to make a promise previous to the election and to carry it out after the election, and that is just what was done in this case.

I simply said that it was a very easy matter to make a bargain before the election and carry it out afterwards. Some of the back benchers on the other side are making so much noise that the minister does not hear correctly what I say. I notice that when things are getting a little too hot for them over there, they always take that way of trying to drown the voice of the speaker; particularly some of these gentlemen from the woolly west.
Now, Sir, the hon. member for Westmoreland (Mr. Emmerson) appealed to me to know whether I favoured expenditure on the Intercolonial Railway. In answer to that appeal I say, that I do favour proper expenditure upon the Intercolonial Railway. And let me say, that so far as this question of the sale of the Intercolonial Railway is concerned, I would at once acquit the Minister of Railways from having the remotest idea of ever making such a sale, or ot even bargaining for such a sale, or having anything to do with negotiations in connection with it. I acquit him because the Minister of Railways is a New Bruns-wicker, and he knows very well the feeling of the people of New Brunswick on that matter. He knows that the building of the Intercolonial Railway was a part of the confederation compact and that the people of New Brunswick would never consent to the Intercolonial Railway being handed over to any private corporation. We are in fa-

vour of any proper and reasonable expenditure upon that road, and I want to say in justice to the Minister of Railways, that along some lines he has made a very proper expenditure upon the Intercolonial Railway, and he has improved that railway to a considerable extent. But I do not go the length of the hon. member for Westmoreland, who said that the minister found it a tramway and made it a great railway ; nor do I go the length of the Minister of Trade and Commerce, who told us they found the terminus of the Intercolonial Railway in a ploughed field. I should think that the hon. gentleman who represents Levis would not thank the Minister of Trade and Commerce for having spoken in such a way of the town of Levis.

But I do say, Mr. Chairman, that many of the expenditures made by the minister on that railway have been wasteful and extravagant, and that the people have not got from that expenditure the good which they ought to have got.

I am surprised at my hon. friend making such a statement. Some little individual piece of marsh land may sell at $150, but the English marsh land will not average more than $100 an acre. I say that expenditure is extravagant, and there are lots'of expenditure along the same line. Wherever the hon. minister has improved the conditions of the road, and done it at a reasonable cost, X would be the first to give him his due meed of credit ; but we have a right to condemn this wasteful and extravagant expenditure. We are anxious that the road should be maintained in a proper state of efficiency. I am glad that the minister extended the Intercolonial Railway to the city of Montreal, and I trust that he will go on and extend it further. I am in favour of making the Intercolonial Railway a great trunk line. In saying this I am stating my individual view ; I do not know to what extent it may accord with the views of gentlemen on this side of the House, but I say I am in favour of a proper and due extension of the Intercolonial Railway. Now, Sir, I do not propose to take up any more time of this committee at present. If there were anything more in the speech of my hon. friend from Westmoreland which required a reply, I should impose on the committee at further length, but I think I have amply replied to the few matters he brought forward.

I says. 'I don't know,' and he says: 'Its all right, I'll see Pottinger about it.' That's all the conversation we had.
Q. You were not going to take the ties on account of their being white spruce?-A. I was going to refuse them.

It called for spruce ties, not for black spruce, and this letter was an instruction to this man to accept white spruce ties. Now, the government railways of this country have managers; they have chief engineers, and this Mr. McManus was acting under the engineer. If the minister had acted in the proper way, he would have instructed the engineer of the railway to tell Mr. McManus that he might inspect these ties the same as the others. No, he comes down from his lofty position as Minister of Railways and tells this gentleman receiving $2 a day, how he should do his work. This whole letter business from beginning to end is a fraud on the face of it. It is disgraceful, and dishonourable to say the least of it. And I will go further and say that my hon. friend from Westmoreland (Mr. Eminerson) must surely have some other object than that which he stated in the House for procuring the letter in the way he did and presenting it to the Committee on Public Accounts as he did.	#

Coming from the province of Ontario as I do-the province that pays the greatest proportion of the taxes of this Dominion-is it not my right and duty as a public man to see that the government railways are conducted in as economical a manner as possible ?	1
challenge any hon gentleman to put his finger on a single syllable used by any gentleman on the Conservative side against the Intercolonial Railway. No hon. gentleman on this side condemns the Intercolonial Railway because it is a government road. What we do, and what we have a right to do, is to condemn unwise and extravagant expenditures on that railway. Do we want more proof than the statement made by the hon. gentleman from Hamilton (Mr. Barker) yesterday ? Since I first had a seat in this House, I have never heard a better statement in connection with the railway than the one made by that hon. gentleman last night. Let it be not forgotten that it is the statement of a gentleman who at one time was general manager of a railway in this country. No more capable man to discuss the affairs of the Intercolonial Railway could be brought forward in this House than the hon. member for Hamilton. And 1 am sure no hon. gentleman can say that my hon friend from Hamilton used language that could possibly have been offensive to hon. gentlemen opposite or to any other. We simply desire to discuss this matter fairly, to give our views frankly, hoping that by so doing we shall assist in making the road a success. And I will go further and say that if justification were needed for the complaints made by hon. members on this side concerning the management of the Intercolonial Railway, it is be found in the statement of the Minister of Railways yesterday. What do we find in that document which the hon. gentleman himself read in this House ? This is a document dated at Moncton, May 1st, 1899, addressed to the Minister! of Railways and Canals and signed by D. Pottinger, general manager. And on the last page of this document, I find the following :
It is difficult to speak with certainty of what ought to be done to meet the demands of the passenger traffic. Both with regard to the locomotives and cars, it is more a question of competition, appearances, speed, comfort and safety, than one of reducing expenses per train mile. ' I feel that you aro quite familiar with the facts, and requirements in regard to this and that I need not say very much about it beyond pointing out that our passenger engines are small and that the condition of our tracks is anything but a good advertisement for our road. A stranger visiting the provinces for the first time would conclude from their appearance that the road was very much embarrassed financially, so poor that it could not afford ic Mr. INGRAM.

Now, I wish to be perfectly clear-I am not trying to make a point against the government with respect to this, but making a statement as a member of this House who, I hope, seeks to offer something that will assist in making that road what it ought to be. And I say that if that road at any time, whether under a Conservative government or under this government, was in the condition here described, it is a disgrace to the Dominion. And, so far as I am concerned, if it is necessary to vote money for the purpose of making that road what it ought to be, and fit to compete with any line of railway in this country, I am prepared to vote what I believe is a sufficient sum to put it in that condition. At the same time, I wish to say as strongly as I can that I entirely disapprove of the methods followed in the management of that railway.
My hon. friend (Mr. Barker) referred to the case of coal purchases as an instance. The hon. member for Westmoreland (Mr. Em-merson) did not complain of any of the expenditures on the Intercolonial Railway. But I challenge him or any hon. gentleman In this House who knows anything about railroading to stand up in this House and discuss these expenditures. One who would not find fault in such a case as this is no true friend of the Intercolonial Railway. It has been admitted in this House that, on the 30th of June, 1900, there were fifteen thousands tons of coal in possession of the road. It has been proven in evidence that there was a feeling of unrest among the coal mines of Nova Scotia even from January or February. These being the circumstances, I charge the management of that railway with being negligent in their duty in not preparing themselves for that threatened strike. In the latter part of December, the railway management found themselves with only six days' supply of coal on hand, and this in the face of a threatened strike of the miners. Is there any railway in this country properly managed who would allow themselves to get so low in coal in the face of this danger of a cessation of supplies ? No, not one railway company in this country would do anything of the kind. What do we find further ? We find an agreement drawn up by the different coal companies in the province along the line of this railway, and we find the coal companies shrewd and sharp enough to have inserted in their

agreement with the government a clause that in case of a strike they should not be hound to furnish the required amount of coal under the contract. Now that is a fact. Do we find the government protecting themselves? Not at all. What ought the government to have 'done in a case of that kind? In preparing their contracts with the coal companies, when the coal companies demanded a clause of this kind, the government should have said:	Here you are demanding a certain thing to protect yourselves: now, we ask that certain protection should be given to us. And what would that be? That a clause should be inserted that in case of a strike by the miners, and in case they could not furnish the required amount of coal to the railway, in case of the government being compelled to buy their coal elsewhere and get a large supply on hand-in that case the government would not be bound to buy the supply agreed upon between the parties. That would have been a proper course to take, that would have been a protection to the government. The government had on hand over $500,000 worth of coal on the 30th of June, 1901. Why were they compelled to have so much on hand? Because, in addition to having a large supply of American coal on hand, they were compelled by their agreement with the coal companies to take the amount which the agreement mentioned. So I say they were remiss in their management of the coal contract with the companies. Every man knows that if you have a large supply of coal on a railway, that coal naturally becomes slack when it is exposed to the weather ; when it is exposed to the rain and the sunshine, it does not have the same heating properties as it would have when taken fresh from the mine. So i say in this instance the government lost a large amount of money in buying coal when the price was something like 50 per cent more than it had been the previous year. The coal they were required to buy during the time of this strike, rose in price, some of it as high as $5.12 a ton, an enormous price to pay for coal, a much larger price than is paid by any railway in this country.
Then we find the same bad management with respect to ties. The manager, under his sworn statement before that committee, says he was the gentleman who prepared the estimates, and he knew that it would only be necessary to have 300.000 or 400,000 ties supplied during that year. What do we find him doing? We find him taking no less than 1,300,000 ties. The question was asked:	Do these ties lose in life by
lying long unused?-No, he did not think so. Why, Sir, he was so inexperienced fn regard to ties that he could not form an estimate of the probable lifetime of ties of any diameter. That man could not say whether or not ties lose in value when lying around year after year without being used. Every man knows well, who has any railway experience at all, that the sooner you
place ties in the railway, the longer they will last. Now I think that is ample with respect to coal and ties.
Now, with respect to engines. I undertook yesterday to interrupt the Minister of Railways and Canals when speaking of engines. I am one of those who believe in Canadian industries. I have had some experience on railways in this country and in the United States; I have been employed on something like seven or eight railways in Canada and the United States, and I know something both of handling engines and of their construction; and I want to criticise Mr. Russell for his course in respect to those engines. Notwithstanding the statement made by the Minister of Railways and Canals that Mr. Russell had been a Canadian, and had been employed on the Intercolonial Railway years ago, I want to point out that he wrote a circular which could be taken advantage of by every manufacturer of engines in the United States-to the effect that these Kingston engines were not up to the mark, and that the Cooke engine was not up to the mark. To allow that to be sent around to the different superintendents and to be reproduced in the public press of this country, I say was a very improper step on the part of Mr. Russell. Why do I say so ? Especially in view of this fact, that Mr. Muhlfeld is a practical man, and Mr. Mulil-feld told him in conversation that the construction of these engines was not to blame, tnat if he had an opportunity of readjusting them he would be able to ascertain whether it was the fault of the engineers who were running the engines, whether it was the fault of the coal, or whether it was the fault of the construction of the engines. Why was not Mr. Russell content with that ? Why did he not instruct this gentleman to take these engines in and perform that readjustment, and try to give them a proper test ? He did nothing of the kind, but he issued this circular, and that is what I condemn him for. I know that these Kingston engines have performed their duties as well and better than a great many engines used on the railways in this country. I have no interest 'whatever in the manufacture of these engines at Kingston, I know that that industry has been used for- the purpose of promoting the interest of the Liberal party in this country; therefore I cannot be charged as a Conservative with any desire to show undue favour to that industry. Therefore I am the more free to say that I consider these Kingston engines are good engines, and I trust that more of them may be employed on that railway.
Now with respect to the rolling stock. Why, Sir, we have it in evidence that hundreds and hundreds of cars on that railway are lying idle ; we have it in evidence by this mechanical superintendent that he does not know the condition of a great deal of the rolling stock. Yet the government is expending large sums of money in purchasing new rolling stock to be used on that rail-

way. Now, would it not be in tlie interest of economy for the officers of that railway to Inspect the rolling stock thoroughly, and when they found some requiring repairs, to make the repairs so that it might be put in service again, thus saving a large sum of money. I can quite understand the indifference of the general manager on that point. What did Mr. Pottinger care about charging up new material to capital account ? If the government and parliament were satis-lied, what had he to do with it ? Why, Sir, if the general manager could get all the money he wants, is he going to exercise economy ? Certainly not. So I say that, instead of buying any more stock, a large amount of that on hand could have been saved by economy and proper management.
Now a good deal has been said about capital account, as respects earnings, and charging up to maintenance, and so forth. I have always understood that in conducting a railway in this country, or any other country, it was the duty of the management first, to conduct their railway as economically as possible; secondly, to keep their expenditure well within their earnings; and thirdly, at the end of the year, to take their expenditure and subtract it from their earnings and show, if possible, a surplus to the stockholders of the company.
1 always understood that was the proper method of conducting a railway in this country, but since I have been in this House I have found that a different method is pursued. A method is pursued whereby they can buy stock for the railway, and when it gets worn out they can simply throw it to one side, get fresh stock, charge it to capital account anti never charge it to maintenance at all. Now, hon. gentlemen have given the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals a certificate of character inasmuch as that hon. gentleman had conducted this railway in a non-partisan spirit. This is a question in regard to which I can fairly take credit to myself, because, when my own friends were in office, I did then, as I do now-I opposed the political influence that was being used on that railway in one way or the other, and from the information which I have from a very reliable source, I believe this same political influence is still in existence in the management of that railway. I want to say that we have in the general manager a gentleman, who, though, to my mind, may have very poor judgment in some cases, has very good judgment in others, but, I do say in that gentleman's behalf, that if he were not interfered with, if he were allowed to manage that railway without any interference from political parties, I believe he would be in a position to show a better record in the administration of the railway. But, as I said before, it is owing to political interference from time to time which is the curse of the management of that railway, and the chief reason why the people have to pay large sums of money that it is now actually termed Mr. INGRAM.
the sink liole of the government in this country.
Now, there is another question with the respect to the extension of sidings. Mr. Pottinger gave evidence under oath in regard to the Copper Crown Company's siding. I want to draw the attention of the hon. member for Westmoreland to the fact that he had better carefully re-read the evidence in connection with the Copper Crown question, and if there are any hon. gentlemen on the other side of the House who will read that evidence very carefully, they will come to the conclusion that there was something materially wrong in connection with this transaction. It is all very well to say that it is a small case, that as it involves an expenditure of only $20,000, it is not worth bothering about, but it is the little things on a railway, when added together at the end of the year, which amount to large sums, and before the hon. minisfier undertakes to expend sums of money from $20,000 and upwards, the general manager should so guide these expenditures that no advantage will be taken, that a hundred cents' worth of material and labour will be furnished for every hundred cents of expenditure. What do we find that the general manager says ? Upon going to interview the Copper Crown Company for the purpose of finding out what the output of the company was, he found that tlie company had exaggerated the output of their mine. That he stated in his evidence. Now, I would like hon. gentlemen in this House to compare this statement with what I am going to say. Where any company or individual want a siding run into their works, the company or individual construct a siding, pay for iP and afterwards, if the railway company have secured freight, and they have continued to secure freight they give the company, or the individual, a rebate on that freight to compensate for the expenditure made on this siding. That would have been a wise course to lwive taken in this case, but what do we find to be the fact ? After the company had exaggerated the amount of material taken out of their mine, the general manager goes away, notwithstanding that fact, and authorizes an expenditure of $20,000 on this siding over which to-day there is not a pound of freight passing, over which only 4,000 tons of freight have passed, and for which something like $3,000 has been paid. And it is a question whether there will ever be a pound of freight passing over that line again. If he had taken the proper course he would have said to this company : Construct your siding, we will haul your freight, and when you have earned sufficient in rebate on your freight you will get your money back. That would have been a guarantee to the people of Canada that they would not lose anything by the transaction, but there is something like $17,000 to date of a loss on the transaction, and there is yet due to Mr. Macdonald $500 for legal

expenses in connection with the transaction. This is one instance of the way in which this railway is conducted.
Again, we have a principle In this House and one which not only applies to the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals, but to the hon. Minister of Agriculture, and to every department of this government, and it is this :	Who has the
better right to pass these estimates ? Whose duty is it, as representatives in this House, to pass these estimates ? Is it not as much our duty to assist in passing these estimates and to criticise them as it is the duty of hon. gentlemen opposite ? Is it not in the interest of the people that we should discuss these estimates ? In an honest discussion of these estimates there should be a method pursued by this government and that method should be that where any public work is to be constructed, I care not whether it is a canal, a railway, a public building, or whatever it is upon which public money is to he expended in this country, the department that wishes to expend this money on such a project, should first have their engineer, or other officer, whose duty it is, give a proper estimate of the cost of the work. Then, once the government agree on a policy in connection with it. and once they agree to perform that work, it is their duty to come down to this House and, supposing a work is to cost $1,000.000 and that the government feel that they cannot expend $1,000,000 this year, let them come down with $200,000 in their estimates for this purpose. Let them say : This $200,000 is to be expended on a certain work: we expect, according to the estimate, that the work will cost $1,000,000, each year following we hope to expend $200,000 until the expiration of five years, when we will have spent $1,000,000 on this work, and this amount, we expect, will complete it. What is the system that, is pursued to-day by the government ? They first come down to the House, and for instance, taking the case of the Sydney Railway extension, they ask for $8,000 to finish this work. Does the hon. Minister of Railways and Canals confine the expenditure to that ? Not at all. What does he do ? He first expends $649 in advertising a work which cost $8,000.
Then he goes on, irrespective of parliament, and he expends nearly $17,000 on a work for which he was only authorized to spend $8,000. Is that the proper duty of government? Is that the way in which the money of the people should be expended ? Certainly not. But it is only one example of the conduct of the Minister of Railways, and of other ministers. We have had a unfortunate spectacle not long ago, of a minister taking some $13,000 out of an expenditure that had been voted in 1901, and applying it to a work that had been begun in 1891. Is not that a disgraceful way to conduct the affairs of the country ? It is simply a farce for the representatives of the people to come to this parliament, and pretend to
pass estimates when we have ministers of the Crown expending the money in whatever way they please and without any reference to what parliament decreed. No language is too strong to condemn such conduct. So long ns I occupy a seat in this House, I shall to the best of my ability protest against such misappropriation of the money votes given by this House. My hon. friend beside me points out that it was sworn to that no less than $1,364.94 was paid for advertising in connection with three roundhouses, and when the general manager of the Intercolonial Railway was asked, why it was necessary to expend such a large sum for such a purpose, what was the answer of this brilliant manager of this government railway ? He told us : People are so busy now and the contractors have so much other work that we cannot secure their services without incurring this large expenditure for advertising. That is something like what we were told the other night, that the government could not get people to accept positions in connection with the census. Well. I congratulate the government. It is the first government that ever had the pleasure of not being able to find people to fill positions. I could speak, Sir. about the Curran railway tie monopoly, and about several other matters, and if I should speak of them, I could speak by the book, because the sworn evidence is before me. I want to knew, are the people of Canada going to stand this kind of thing from any government ? I want to know if they will allow ministers to do these things. When Mr. McManus, inspector of ties, was changed from his position as tie inspector to be assistant inspector of lumber, a question was asked of Mr. Russell, the manager of the Intercolonial Railway, as to the reason of tnat change, and the Minister of Railways thought it his duty to get up and object. In no business concern in the world would a question of that kind be objected to by the man who conducted the business. It is the most absurd thing I ever heard of. Had such an objection come from the member for Westmoreland or from others on that side, it would not be so strange, because they believed it their duty so far as they can to burk any inquiry that may damage the government, but when the objection comes from the Minister of Railways, who is responsible for the Intercolonial Railway, it is all the stranger still. I hope at a later period, and before these estimates are passed, to discuss other questions about the expenditure of public money. I trust that I shall do so without offending my opponents, and that whatever I say may add something to help to make the government railway what it ought to be-a paying concern to the people of this country.

to commend the action of the railway administration at Moncton, which is well known the Dominion over, never wittingly to have sinned for the love of the Liberal party. I speak with some reluctance, because it was not my intention to take part in the debate, but if X did not refute some of the statements made by the hon. member for King's (Mr. Fowler) it might have gone to the province of New Brunswick that the member for Gloucester, from whose district largely these ties were supplied, felt that something had been done that ought not to have been done. I believe I am in a better position than perhaps other hou. gentlemen in this House to give a statement in relation to this matter. In a previous debate I dealt somewhat extensively with the general administration of the Intercolonial Railway, and I shall content myself now by referring to some matters of more local import. X expected that the hon. member for Iving's (Mr. Fowler) would have delivered an oration which would have gone to the province of New Brunswick as a great condemnation of the administration of the Intercolonial Railway, but the hon. gentleman's speech was short and ineffective. Far be it from me to impute a motive to any member on either side of this House, but sometimes I am amazed at the extraordinary memory of some gentlemen opposite, in its pliability to the requirements or the needs of whatever case they are trying to make out. When the inspector of ties was before the committee, he swore that he inspected ties for Mr. Curran and for Mr. Culligan, and for other parties during many years past. The hon. member for Hamilton (Mr. Barker), who was the chief cross-examiner before the Public Accounts Committee, got up in his place and left it to be inferred by the House and by the country that the contract to Mr. Curran had been awarded before the election, and in order to serve the purposes of the election. The hon. gentleman (Mr. Barker) made this statement in view of the sworn evidence of Mr. Pottin-ger, general manager, that the contract given to Frank Curran for ties was given in December, 1900, or in the early days of January, 1901, several months after the election, and therefore could not have been given for the purpose of influencing the electorate at that time. The general manager himself explained in his evidence, the first day he came before the Public Accounts Committee, that he had advertised for ties for the following year, just as he had done every year since the inception of the road. It is always in the fall of the year, in September, October, and sometimes in November, that ties are asked for by tenders for the next year. He stated that he required at least 000,000 ties for the following summer, and he made an appeal for tenders to the amount of 800,000, as the supplies of previous years had Mr. TURGEON.
invariably run short of meeting the requirements of the road. And I am hear to say that in the years 189S and 1899, Mr. Pott-Inger sometimes sent emissaries to me from Moncton, begging me to try to secure immediately in the district to which I belong ties of which the railway was short. On some occasions I was not able to do it, and they had to get the ties from the upper end of the province of Quebec in order to supply the foremen and the trackmen in the province of New Brunswick and the province of Nova Scotia what they required. Therefore, I say that when the general manager asked for 800,000 ties and in answer to that requisition obtained only 335,000, he was more than justified in taking the course he did. He was not influenced by any political or personal consideration, for I know that Mr. Pottinger has no personal interest in Mr. Curran, but he was bound to secure all the ties he would require for the following year ; and after having given that contract for 185,000 ties or thereabout, to Frank Curran, he was still short of the requirement. It has been stated in this evidence that he only gave that contract after having received in reply to his request tenders for only 350,000 ; and I ask every member of this House who has been in any way connected with railroads, if, after failing to get during the winter the supply of ties required for the following summer, he was not obliged to remain without them until the next winter. Therefore, the contract was given for no political consideration, but as a matter of necessity for the requirements of the road.
Then, again, comes the fact that after having given that contract to Frank Curran, the department had not yet contracted for the full quantities required for the next summer, and knowing by past experience that every summer he had been put to in-corivience because of the scarcity of ties and knowing also that the best quality of lumber for ties is getting scarcer and scarcer every year in our district, he said to those contractors, ' bring me all you can.' Is it to be supposed that for political considerations the general manager bought a number of ties and left them over for another year ? The road is bound to run for another year, and what is bought in one year will not have to be bought the next year. No doubt the reason why the general manager succeeded in getting a larger quantity of ties than he expected was that many men on the north shore, in the counties of Restigouehe and Gloucester, and I may say Northumberland as well, were induced to go into the tie business, which would enable them to stay at home during the winter instead of going into the lumber camps.
Then this stock of ties would be as valuable to the road the next year as it would have been this year. I even go further, and speak not from my own authority, but from the authority of men who have had

twenty or twenty-five years of experience on railroads in our district-not on the government railroad, but on railroads of private corporations. I speak especially from the authority of the traekmaster of the Caraquet Railway, which runs through the same district. He claims that if he had the means to do so, he would get all his ties a year in advance, because when a tie has been dried for a year it is more valuable and will last longer in the ground than a tie which is cut fresh from the wood.
Again the statement is made that the ties were no good. I know that complaints were macfe against the inspector. I know nothing personally of the action of the inspector. Although belonging to that district, I never had the pleasure of meeting the inspector from the time the contract was signed until I returned home last summer after my parliamentary duties had ended in June. It was while parliament was in session that I heard the complaint made against the inspector of receiving ties which were not according to the specifications. I might also add that while in this House last spring I received letters from some of my friends complaining of the difficulty they had to get their ties accepted by Inspector McManus, claiming that he was too strict, and that he should not have rejected their ties.
My own personal investigation has shown me that these men had a certain quantity of ties which were certainly not acceptable, and which Mr. McManus refused to accept. Regarding the letter of the minister about which so much has been said, in our locality the inspector has stated that there are two or three kinds of spruce, but that the best kind, which is black spruce, does not grow there. We only see it once in a while, and the spruce which he called white spruce is the ordinary spruce of the country. It is a quality of wood which is certainly even better than cedar for ties. Men of experience know that the white spruce will hold nails for the first five years better than cedar, and therefore is as valuable as cedar itself, which is considered a first class quality of wood for the purpose. I may say also that the supply of cedar is becoming exhausted in that district, so that it is a matter of necessity for the management of the road to accept the spruce which grows in that country. If the black spruce grew there, it is certainly to some extent superior to the white, but it is only a portion of the black spruce, at the butt of the tree, which can be used for ties. Some times out of one tree you will only get one first class tie, because ten or twelve feet from the root the wood has no more value for this purpose than the white spruce. When, therefore, the hon. minister, at the request of the contractor, whose political feelings cannot be appealed to for he is a well reputed Conservative, who worked for the Conservative party even after
he got this letter from the minister, accepted white spruce, he did what any business man would have done. No other spruce could be found in that locality, and it was in that locality the minister had to get his supply. That letter therefore, instead of reflecting on the conduct of the minister, shows that he had a practical knowledge of the locality and of the quality of wood required and which could be had there.
In answer to complaints a second inspection was ordered, and according to hon. gentlemen opposite that made a bad showing. Well, I claim that the ties which were supplied by these contractors and received by the inspector were fully equal in quality to those that were always received on the Intercolonial Railway during the administration of the late government. It has been shown also by the evidence of Mr. Pottinger and the inspector of ties that section foremen or traekmasters or roadmasters are often employed as inspectors themselves or as assisting the inspector, and it is well known that sectionmen, as a rule, are fully competent to judge the quality of ties which they are handling. In our district we have seven or eight section foremen. The county of Gloucester is an extensive county, and we have seven or eight sections running through it, and every one of the foremen employed-and who have been employed on the road fifteen or twenty years in most cases-declared over their own signature, and are ready to declare the same under oath if the opposition members want to call them as witnesses, that the ties received are just as good as those which had been received in previous years ever since they have been employed on the railway, and are even perhaps superior, if any discrimination is to be made. I now hold their signed statement in my hand. But these hon. gentlemen do not want to call these men. They only want the evidence of Mr. P. S. Archibald, and failing to get him they want none at all. We can conclude therefore that they must have a motive in refusing every other evidence except that of Mr. Archibald, who they called an engineer of the road. But Mr. Archibald has not been on the road during the last five years and as the reasons which brought about his dismissal have been referred to at length, I need not discuss them now. The inspector has declared himself that, according to his judgment, he was not accustomed to follow strictly the specifications but used his discretion in that respect, and he is a competent man who has been engaged in the lumber and tie business all his life. It is admitted by members on the other side, and it lias been proved, as well, that Mr. Chas. McManus is an honest man and that his family is one of the most honoured and respectable and well known perhaps in Nova Scotia as well as in New * Brunswick.
I do not think I need extend my remarks any further. All I intended was to sub-

stantiate the evidence of Mr. Pottinger and also the evidence of the inspector, as far as I could from my personal knowledge, and especially commend to this House the sound judgment of the present Minister of Railways when, travelling over the road and inspecting its work, in company with the officials, he took the action he did in the interests of the road and acting on the advice of most competent men.

That so long as the government continues to manufacture twine, the same shall be offered for sale directly to farmers up to July the 1st of each year at cost of material and manufacture, calculating wages on the basis of fair wages for free labour ; and that the twine unsold and on hand on July 1st of each year be sold by tender to the highest bidder, after advertisement.
We consider now that we are bound by this resolution of the House, and the result has
been as follows. The annual output of the penitentiary was 500 tons. Acting on this resolution, the farmers were called on to come and purchase binder twine. As a result, up to the 1st of July we had applications from 850 farmers. Of these 220 were from Prince Edward Island, 17 from New Brunswick, 130 from Quebec, 85 from Manitoba, 24 from the North-west Territories, 1 from British Columbia, and 359 from Ontario. The average of these orders was 120 pounds, and the total amount purchased was 45 tons ; so that on the 1st of July we found ourselves in possession of something over 300 tons of binder twine out of the total production of 500 tons. We had to keep it until the 1st of July for the farmers, and then we sold it at public auction. We called for tenders, and there were three tenders put in, and the binder twine was awarded to a man named Henderson Black, of St. John's in the province of Quebec. Of course, we sold the twine at a sacrifice, because at that time the farmers had all made their purchases, and the people in the trade had obtained their stock. It is absolutely impossible for us to do business there if we are going to conform to this resolution, and the loss on the business of last year is in the vicinity of $10,000. We are in the hands of the House if the House maintains this resolution ; but while I am at the head of the department, I will not take the responsibility of carrying on business on any such conditions.

I also mail you to-day, under particular cover, half a dozen of the samples and some circulars. You will notice that our 'pure manllla' and 'standard' stocks are exhausted and consequently I am not sending you the samples of these brands.

Therefore on the 17th June every particle of pure manilla which was manufactured was exhausted, and every particle of the standard, so that it is hardly fair to say that the farmers did not take advantage of their opportunities. But if the penitentiary is going to manufacture a kind of twine which is not used, it must expect to have it left on hand.

But the minister has not been giving attention to the demands of the farmers. He has been manufactu-ing a kind of twine which the farmers do not require. The kind of twine which the farmers do require was all sold on the 17th June under the new resolution.

Hon. Mr. IiOSS (Victoria, N.S.). I know a little about binder twine and a good deal about cordage. The same rule applies to both. If you want a first-class binder twine, you must make it of pure manilla* The second-class is a mixture with sisal, and the third is almost altogether sisal.

PUGSLEY.,,"The hon. Minister of Justice gave the figures of the consumption in Canada last year. How much of it was made in the country ? Why can we not manufacture binder twine in this country instead of bringing it from the United States ? The government can start that machinery running and make a success of It because the country requires manilla and standard twines. If you look at the Auditor General's report, page M-50, you will find that the sales were as follows :
Pure manilla (Maple Leaf) 66,088 pounds, average i rice, 11J cents to 12 cents per pound.
Sisal, 13,051i pounds, average price, 9 cents per pound.
Mixed manilla (Monarch), 4,360 pounds, average price, 81 cents per pound.
Standard, 26,430 pounds, average price, 71 cents per pound.
Beaver, 71,5151 pounds, average price, 9 cents per pound.
New Zealand (Red Tape), 60 pounds, average price 8 cents.
These are the prices the government asked the farmers to pay and they are high prices. If you will turn to the statement of raw material in the Auditor General's report you will find that they did not buy a pound of pure manilla. They bought New Zealand fibre, something that they ought uot. to have bought at all because It will only make third or fourth rate binder twine. They bought of New Zealand fibre 90,306 pounds, sisal 439,985 pounds, and manilla fibre 135,540 pounds. But, the great bulk of the raw material was New Zealand fibre which we purchased to make twine out of. So that, they made a very inferior article. Whether this was due to the fact of manilla being too dear or not I do not know, but, I maintain that the government can manufacture binder twine the same as any other manufacturing industry in the country would do. Or. if they do not wish to do that, let them rent the machinery to some person

who will carry on the industry and the convict labour with it. Let them rent this industry to somebody who will start the machinery humming and make money out of it. In this way the government will be able to control the American ring and Canadian combination. These people have kept the price of binder twine up ever since this government took control of the industry, This government cancelled the policy of the late government in regard to the binder twine Industry. The late government had engaged a man to go out as a travelling agent and sell the output of the industry for five years. Since hon. gentlemen opposite have come into power they have cancelled the appointment of thp travelling agent and they have sold to the Hobbs Hardware Company, and to some others of their friends without asking for tenders at all, simply sending a letter out to one of two of their friends. Moreover, they sold the twine at a loss. I do not think the government were justified in selling it at 4 or 5 cents a pound to this firm in St. John. If they could not get a satisfactory price they should have held it over until next season and got 10, 12 or 15 cents a pound for it as I presume the farmers would be willing to pay this in view of the fact that the American and Canadian combinations have joined hands for the purpose of squeezing them. If the hon. minister asks his hon. friend the member for Alberta (Mr. Oliver) to introduce a resolution similar to that which he moved last year, I am satisfied that all hands will vote for it. Let the hon. minister either establish this industry on a business footing, or let him rent the machinery, together with the convict labour, to a private individual.

If by running it as a government institution we lose a little money perhaps this would be more than compensated for by the saving which it would enable the farmers to make in the purchase of their binder twine. It may be that the officials in control of this industry are in need of ideas and do not keep pace with the times, and perhaps, though the person in control may be a skilled artisan, his ideas are not up to date.

If that institution has the effect of preventing a combination in binder twine, we will reap beneficial results from it just as we reap beneficial results from our canal system which keeps down the transportation rates. I agree that it would be well now to start that machinery to produce a certain amount of binder twine. Now that the transaction has passed.

However, if we are going to manufacture binder twine then the government should not be hedged around with such a resolution as that but should be allowed to have a free hand to dispose of the twine in the best interests of the people. My hon. friend from Peel (Mr. Blain) no doubt knows a good deal about binder twine, but when he says that the government should manufacture only two kinds, I would ask him is he not aware of the fact that other manufacturers are making several kinds of twine and disposing of it successfully.

PUGSLEY.,,"Since the Inauguration of this industry in the Kingston penitentiary I have been watching its career with some interest. I was in this House when it was established and I favoured it then. Sir John Thompson took a very deep Interest in this question at the time. His expectation was that it would have the effect of

controlling the price of binder twine to some extent. I am free to confess that under the Conservative regime the disposal of the twine was not as successful as we had hoped, but there was the excuse for that that it was our first attempt in undertaking a new industry, and we had to do it in face of the most bitter opposition from the other manufacturers of binder twine. X do not hesitate to say that such opposition still exists. Let me point out that au increased charge for binder twine is a far greater tax on the farmers than the duty on agricultural implements, because a farmer will use every year from 500 to
1.000	pounds, and a difference of four or five cents a pound in the price-and they seem to charge whatever price for it .that they can get from the farmers-means yearly a tax of $40 or $50 on each farmer which is rather a serious matter. The minister stated that something like 850 pounds had been bought in Manitoba previous to July. There was nearly a car load of this twine sold in Carberry last year, and I used
1.000	pounds myself. I think the grade was inferior to that mentioned by the hon. member for Peel, but nevertheless it gave satisfaction. This was the first year the penitentiary managed the business under the new system, and in many cases the farmers knew nothing about the sale of the twine until near the expiry of the time allowed. We may imagine that information given in this House spreads rapidly, but frequently it does not. From listening to the minister to-night I would judge that officials in the penitentiary are like other officials ; they do not like innovations. They do not like people from the outside to tell them how they should do their business and I expect that the officials in charge of the manufacture of this twine are like all others in that respect. They do not care to be dictated to, and they have no doubt very little confidence in the members of this House who might be considered by others as experts in the binder twine business. In all probability the minister may ascertain later on that something of that spirit of personal pride accounts for the failure of the twine industry at the penitentiary. If the minister of Justice, active and energetic as he is, had himself been in charge of the binder twine, there would be a different story to tell. Now, as to what the member for Guys-borough said. It is all very well for a gentleman like him to treat this question lightly but if he represented a constituency as we from the west do, where this is a very important question, he would possibly be one of the loudest in support of this industry which he wishes to have wiped out. I would remind the hon. gentleman that there are certain government enterprises in the east which do not pay their way, but nevertheless we in the west have to grin and bear it. I think that possibly this item had better stand until the minister comes
down at some future day with a proposal. He is young and energetic and if he will only take the interest in the matter that the late Sir John Thompson did, he will make a success of the business. There is no reason why the convicts should be idle. They might as well be employed at that work as anything else, and I have learned from some of the officials that the manufacture of the binder twine is a most desirable employment for them, and especially for the long term prisoners. At all events it would be very unfortunate if we should act on the hasty and ill considered suggestion of the hon. member for Guysborough (Mr. Fraser).

They believe that by making - certain reductions in salaries and so forth, we will be able to carry it on without any great loss if not at a profit. We have always to bear in mind the very serious question of finding employment for the convicts, and it was in order to meet that difficulty that this business was inaugurated. If I take what has been said to-night and especially the opinion of the experts who have spoken, the conclusion I am driven to is that the officials more immediately in charge of the binder twine industry have not kept up to date, and are not equal to the position they occupy ; and I am going to say here now, that while I give my loyal assistance to any man so long as he is with me, no man is going to remain long with me who is not equal to the position he occupies. With respect to the system of disposing of the twine, my hon. friend from Leeds (Mr. Taylor) said a moment ago that there ought to be agents on the road. Let us deal with our experience. That system was inaugurated, and what was the result ? In 1S95 over $30,000 -worth of twine was sold by an agent and delivered. Previous to the month of November he was actually paid for the greater part of it. When the change of government took place in 1896 we had not received a dollar of the money that had been paid to the agent. Up to within a few days ago there was over $9,000 still due on the twine sold by that agent at that time. I am not making this statement for the purpose of recrimination at all. The product of the year 1895-6 had not been disposed of when the change of government took place in July, 1896, because of the difficulty in connection with the agent. There is our experience which I am stating simply to show the difficulties attendant on the management of this industry. After that I conceive that it was justifiable on the part of the government to endeavour to dispose of this twine by public auction.

What ought we to do ? We ought to take account of what has been said to-night, make inquiries of those familiar with the situation, make the kind of twine that is suitable to the market, and then dispose of it in the right way. The question is, ought we to sell it through an agent or by public auction ? Our experience with an agent has not been satisfactory.

If the idea should prevail that it does not pay to manufacture it in the penitentiary in the east, let that industry be moved to the penitentiary at Winnipeg, where it would be in close proximity to the wheat fields where most of its product is used. In 1900 binder twine was quoted very high in the west. In the towns of southern Manitoba, it was quoted in the spring of that year as high as 18 cents a pound. A number of our farmers refused to give orders at that price, and communicated with Mr. Platt, the manager of the Kingston penitentiary works, and got quotations from him. They were not able to get the first quality of twine but used the second which proved very satisfactory. It costs us a shade over ten cents, when the regular dealers were quoting the first quality at 15 cents and the second at 14 cents.

I agree in the opinion expressed that it would be a mistake to close up the concern at Kingston, because these large factories are liable to get into the hands of a combine, which would be a lamentable affair for the farmers. Even if the penitentiary industry does not pay, it would still be an advantage to the country to keep it up. As to the mode of selling the twine, I have no doubt that the Minister of Justice will find some trouble in that regard. Some of our farmers in my constituency complain of the great expense of sending the twine by express. Many who ordered twine from the penitentiary have had to pay very large express charges, and some did not get the twine they ordered, but perhaps that was their own fault in possibly not having ordered it soon enough. One of the farmers in my county was very wrothy about this. He said that he had ordered a certain amount of first quality manilla twine, and got word back that his order was put in and would be filled as soon as he sent word to have the twine forwarded. He sent the money down and they sent him an inferior brand of twine, and he said he would not order from Kingston again. Our farmers complain very much about the heavy express charges. Perhaps if the hon. minister would have stations in certain parts of the country, to whicn he could send carloads of twine, he would thereby get rid of this difficulty. He could choose points in all the different provinces to which carloads could be sent, and to which the farmers could drive for what they wanted. That would be different from appointing a number of agents to travel about.

PUGSLEY.,,"I am glad to hear the hon. member (Mr. McGowan) speak on this subject. The question of binder twine is one of the most important that we have in the west. The hon. member for Lisgar (Mr. Stewart) has told us that he represents a county whose product of wheat last year amounted to 12,000,000 bushels. My county adjoins his on one side. Though it did not raise 12,000,000 bushels it raised almost as much. This will give some idea of how important this question of binder twine is to us. The Minister of Justice should take into consideration the question whether it is well to have all the binder twine manufactured at Kingston. In the Stony Mountain penitentiary, Which is in my county, there are, I think, about 120 prisoners, and these prisoners hardly know what to do with their time. 1 understand that sometimes they are engaged in making roads, but there is not enough work for them. I do not see why the raw material should not to be sent to Stony Mountain as well as to Kingston and the twine that is required on the prairies of Manitoba and the North-west manufactured at Stony Mountain. But, until that is done, I do not see why the twine could not be sent up in car lots, not through agents, but sent to different points, such as Brandon, Portage la Prairie, Prince Albert, Edmonton, and other points throughout the west, where the farmers can buy it and pay spot cash. If the farmers could get binder twine at 9 cents or 10 cents, instead of paying 18 cents, it would be a great help. The present Minister of Justice, who is an energetic and progressive man, should look into this question. I hope he will do something this year to bring the twine to the west and put it into the hands of farmers at the most advantageous prices.

The farmers would be able to get the binder twine and get it at a reduced price. At present this manufacture of binder twine is of very little use to us. The farmers came to me last year and wished me to get twine for them. But the freight is high; it was out of the question to get it by express, and nobody cared to take the responsibility of ordering a carload. But I am sure that the burser or jailer in these different institutions in the west would be willing to take charge of consignments and sell them for spot cash to the farmers.

PUGSLEY.,,"As I was the mover of the original motion of last year, there may be some responsibility attaching to my suggestion to change the system of selling the twine. I wish to draw the committee's attention to the fact that the original motion I moved contained no clause to the effect that the binder twine on hand after the 1st of July should be sold to the highest bidder. That is the portion of the resolution as carried that I objected to. The resolution as I moved it, was as follows :
That in the opinion of this House it is expedient that all binder twine now held by the government, together with all twine that may hereafter be manufactured by them, shall be sold direct to the farmer at a price to cover the actual cost of raw material and manufacture only, with one cent per pound added, and that no twine manufactured or paid for out of the Dominion treasury shall be sold or disposed of in any other way.
The amendment moved by the hon. member for Alberta (Mr. Oliver) added the provision about selling the twine on hand after the first of July. I venture to say that if that clause had not been added to the motion, all the twine would have been sold last year to the farmers, for, at the close of the season there was a great scarcity of twine both in Ontario and in the west. I venture to say, also, that, with the omission of that clause the motion as I presented it covers the best system for the sale of the small quantity of binder twine-for it is a small quantity in comparison to the quantity consumed throughout the country-that the government manufactures. As to what the hon. member for Wellington (Mr. McGowan) has said, I think the government system of filling orders is as up-to-date as that of any manufacturing establishment in Canada. The farmer sends in his order at any time after the beginning of the year. He can order a small quantity if he chooses. His order is booked. He can send his money down as the season approaches and the twine is sent direct to his address. The reason why some farmers did not get their twine exactly at the time they wanted it and why it was sent forward by express was that, instead of sending their money a month or two weeks before they wanted the twine, they waited until the eleventh hour. I am sure that the reason why it was sent forward by express was that the managers of the institution knew that it was needed in the wheat fields at the time. I think the government should continue the manufacture of binder twine as they are now manufacturing it. but that they should change to the extent of manufacturing what is understood as pure maniila only.

This they should sell direct to the farmers as they are now doing, omitting that clause of the resolution which was added, for the reason that the harvest in the wheat fields in the west, about which we hear so much, does not come on until our harvest in Ontario is about finished. If there is any twine in the Kingston establishment that the farmers in Ontario do not buy before the 1st of July, it can be sent to the west and there find a ready market, at prices that will pay the government well. I hope the hon. minister will continue this industry. 1 do not wish to unreasonably criticise the government with respect to the manufacture of binder twine. It need not be manufactured at a loss; the government can make money, even though manufacturing the small quantity that the capacity of the works will permit. If they continue the manufacture of the proper twine and put it on the market in the early season they will have no trouble in selling every pound they are able to manufacture.

I would like to know whether the spirit of the resolution passed by the House last year was carried out. I know that the farmers of this country are reading people; I know that they want to get a bargain when they can, and I know that they have the money to pay for it. They certainly would have bought the twine manufactured by the government at Kingston if they could have got it at a lower price than other manufacturers were selling it for. We are told that the binder twine was put in at cost, but it may have been that the raw stock that the government used was bought at too high a price. I believe that last year the government could have sold all their twine if they had put it in at cost to the farmers.

By this means the problem would be solved and the department relieved of all difficulty in the way of disposing of the product. But speaking seriously. I wish to join in the expression of opinion of a number of my hon. friends from the west. Last year when the matter was discussed, I stated that, under present conditions, the farmers of Manitoba and the North-west Territories were not in a position to reap as much advantage as the farmers of Ontario, who were near the point of manufacture. As a matter of fact, while the business of wheat-growing in the west is a great one. it is yet in some degree a lottery. There is no guarantee of the extent Mr. BLAIN.
of a wTheat crop until a short time before harvest. It is, therefore, impossible for a wheat-grower in Manitoba or the territories to place an absolute order for his binder twine until late in July, too late to admit of his sending on order and having it filled all the way from Kingston by ordinary freight transportation. I suggested then to the government that it would be a good policy to ship a few carloads of twine to centres in Manitoba and the territories. There might be some risk, doubtless there would be some risk of the shipments remaining unsold, but not more than is incurred by holding all the output at Kingston, and I am confident that a considerable quantity could thus be disposed of to the advantage of the business from the departmental point of view and of the western wheat-growers.

The penitentiary reserve contained 170 acres. To this was added the Gagnon farm, 38 acres, purchased from John Loftus, in March this year, at $75 per acre, making $2,850. This is especially valuable, because of a quantity of building-sand it contains. It is proposed to add three parcels aggregating 145 arpents (1224 acres) making about 350 acres In the reserve. Of this, 300 will be available for farming purposes. The farm will toe worked by convict labour. For some years farm products to the value of $3,500 a year, have been purchased for consumption in the penitentiary.
A vote is asked to pay for these parcels :
1.	Maxime Archambault, about fifty arpents at $89 per arpent, $4,450.
This land adjoins the penitentiary quarry farm. The soil is of excellent quality throughout, thoroughly cultivated, clean and well kept. Stone of like quality and dimension to that in the penitentiary quarries underlies eight or ten acres close to the quarries. The possession of this addition to the quarry will ensure an ample supply of exceptionally fine building stone for future requirements.
2.	Hector Lussier, about forty-five arpents at $76 per arpent, $3,420.
This land lies east of the St. Frangois road between the railway station grounds and the road of the quarries. Soil rich and deep. It is conveniently situated near the penitentiary and in full view of the guards on the towers.
3.	Joliceour, about 30 arpents at $55 per arpent, $2,750.
Four acres of south end is rocky, next is a strip of three acres of sandy loam. The balance is clay. The soil is good, tout its cultivation has been neglected.
At Dorchester the increase is caused by the fact that we are making provisions for the salary of a chief keeper, $800, for an instructor, $700, and for a fireman, $500.

Land can be bought, not for $55 an acre, the price that the minister quoted as being charged in Ontario, but for $7 or $8 per acre-land which will yield 30 or 40 bushels of wheat to the acre.

If we can do that and get the land on business principles we are prepared to do it. In respect to making a road to Winnipeg, of course, that is not possible. A prisoner cannot be taken beyond the prison reserve because if he is he is at large. This is a question of the number of guards to he employed. We have been overburdened with guards there in proportion to population because we have no wall to keep the convicts confined, and if we were to send them out to build roads to Winnipeg I am afraid we would have to consider the propriety of increasing our allowance for guards in that district.
