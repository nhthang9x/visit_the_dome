FRASER (Guysborough) moved :,,ALEXANDER GIBSON RAILWAY AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY.,,,"That the petition of the Alexander Gibson Ra.lway and Manufacturing Company presented this day, for leave to present a petition for an Act, be read and received, and referred to the Committee on Standing Orders.
He said:	I might explain to the House
the reason for this motion. This company, which does business in the province of New Brunswick, are operating a railway, which they got power from this parliament in 1898 to take over. Being a provincial corporation, they believed that the legislature of New Brunswick had power to authorize the separation of the railway from the manufacturing business, and that they could obtain an Act from that legislature for -such a purpose; but they have recently been advised that it will be necessary or advisable to obtain an Act of the parliament of Canada for that purpose. They find now that they cannot work the two very well together, and by the time they learned that it would be necessary to come to this House, the time for presenting petitions had expired. All they want now, with the full consent of the shareholders, is to have provision made simply for running the railway under a separate company from the other business. Under these exceptional circumstances, I trust that the House will grant them the privilege of introducing this petition and having it go to the committee.

It is not intended in any way to limit the number of charters nor to impose any unreasonable or unnecessary conditions upon railway promoters. The Bill is aimed chiefly at what are known as speculative charters, or charters which are obtained by parties for the purpose of embarrassing companies which are in possession of constructed works. The Bill, in brief, provides that parties who apply for railroad charters shall accompany their applications with a sum equivalent to $200 per mile of the proposed road, which'sum shall be deposited with the government, and on the completion of the proposed work shall be returned to the company with all accumulated interest; but if the work be not proceeded with, then the $200 per mile shall be forfeited to the government of Canada. The Bill is not perhaps as complete in form as it might be, and I am well aware that at this late hour of the session such a Bill introduced by a private member can hardly be pressed to a successful conclusion. However, my idea in presenting it at this time is to bring the matter to the attention of the Minister of Railways,-the members of the House and the public in general, in order that the difficulties which now exist may be dealt with by some kind of legislative enactment, if not by such a Bill as this, then by some other Bill or by a general provision to be inserted in the general Act which the Minister of Railways is now pressing. When one considers that the total railway mileage constructed in Canada to-day is approximately about 18,500 miles and that session after session charters are granted for anywhere from
10,000	to 15,000 miles of new railway-I believe this session for about 12,000 miles; and when one also considers that about a third of the time of this House as well as a great deal of hard committee work is taken up in considering these measures, and that from 75 to 80 per cent of them never materialize, one must come to the conclusion that a great many of the charters now granted are taken out by the promoters for speculative purposes, to be hawked around and sold when occasion offers, or else for the purpose of embarrassing others. It may be that the true way out of the difficulty would be what is known as free trade in railroad charters, a system which I be-Mr. FRASER.
lieve prevails in some of the United States, where one is merely required to have ithe plans and proflies prepared and filed and the work proceeded with. I think, myself, there is a good deal to be said in favour of that system, provided proper financial guarantees are taken that the railway shall be proceeded with and constructed.
In discussing the matter with an hon. member yesterday, he argued that such a Bill would be in the interests of large corporations and strike a blow at men of moderate financial standing. I think, however, that my hon. friend will find upon reflection that there is nothing in that argument. Men of moderate financial standing should not ask for charters for 500 or 1,000 or 1,500 miles of railway, as in all probability they will not be able to carry out their undertaking. But if they ask for moderate charters, there Is no reason why they should not be able to put up the $200 a mile, knowing well that if their application be in good faith, the money will come back to them. I think that this is an opportune time to bring the matter before the House, in order that it may be dealt with if possible in a general Act. No doubt the Bill is not perfect in all its details, but any such imperfections can be remedied. I believe that where any substantial performance of the undertaking has taken place no forfeiture should be insisted on, or where the failure is due to some difficulty of an unforeseen character, such as a crisis in the money market or a temporary shortage of railway material, or where there has been a part performance, there should be a pro rata adjustment. But where there has been absolutely no performance or an attempt at performance, there should be an absolute forfeiture of the. deposit.

SPROULE (East Grey).,,INCORPORATION OF RAILWAY COMPANIES.,,,"I am afraid that my hon. friend will find that his Bill will not accomplish what he desires, if the history of the past may be taken as an index of what will happen in the future. We know how easily deposits made to guarantee contracts are returned to the parties who have failed in their obligations. Take for instance the elevator matter at Montreal, in which a deposit was made with the government, but after keeping it a length of time the government returned the money. We have other instances of the same nature. Some two or three years ago, when a Bill was before the Railway Committee asking incorporation for a company to build a railway in the Yukon district, the company offered to put up a deposit, but the members of the Railway Committee who were supporters of the government,-I do not know; if the hon. gentleman took part or not in that committee-absolutely refused to require a deposit on the ground that it was establishing a bad principle and voted down the motion made to require a deposit as a guarantee of the building of the road. Remembering these things and knowing how

easy it is for companies to put up excuses for not accomplishing what they have bound themselves to do, and how easy it will be for them to take advantage of that provision in the hon. gentleman's Bill which provides for a non-exaction of the forfeit condition in certain cases, or for a pro rata return of the deposit made, in my opinion the Bill will practically he of no effect whatever.

He said : This Bill is intended to amend the General Inspection Act regarding hides, skins and leather. It is intended to apply only to the cities mentioned, namely : Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, Kingston, Toronto, Hamilton and London. I have no objection to extending it further, but I have limited it to these places because they are the centres of the hide business of this country. The object is to have hides inspected wherever practicable, green and uncured, because I am informed that a perfect inspection cannot be had after the hides are salted or cured. It is intended also to have the green or uncured hides inspected in order to compel a proper flaying of the animals by the butchers. I am instructed that at present, owing to the careless way in which the animals are killed and their hides taken off, a great deal of waste material remains in the hide, and if the inspector were obliged to lower the standard of the hides because of improper or unskilful flaying, that would improve the hides in their value. The Bill also aims at preventing any frauds in the inspection such as have hitherto existed, such as resalting or watering the hides and thus increasing the weight, the hides being purchased or sold by the weight. The effect of the Bill will also be to create a uniform inspection in the districts in which it is put into operation. The experience in other places will I think warrant this House in passing a measure of this kind. I am advised that by reason of a more careful inspection in Liverpool, the quality and price of hides has greatly increased, and no doubt a similar result will follow a perfect system of inspection in this country. This Bill, like that of my hon. friend's from Wellington (Mr. Guthrie), is introduced somewhat late in the session, and if hon. members desire to have time to circulate it among their constituents in order to ascertain the views of those engaged in the business, it would not become me to press it to a final reading this session. I have not consulted the Minister of Inland Revenue and therefore the same remark applies to him, but I have endeavoured in this Bill to carry out the ideas I have expressed, 90
and which I think will have the effect of improving the quality and price of the hides bought and sold in this country.

The Governor General may, by a proclamation or order whichever he considers most expedient, and whenever he deems it necessary, prohibit the 'landing in Canada of any immigrant or any other passenger who is suffering from any dangerous or infectious disease or malady, whether such immigrant intends to settle in Canada, or oily intends to pass through Canada to settle In some other country.

2	and 3. No final conclusion has been reached, but if the revenue of the office continues to increase it may in the public interest be necessary to make a change. Whilst there is no hard and fast rule upon the subject, still when the revenue of a post office attains such proportions as to afford a fair and reasonable living to the postmaster it is considered not unreasonable in the public interest that he should give his undivided attention to the affairs of the office. Ordinarily a change of postmaster under such circumstances would involve the carrying on of the office in a separate building.

House of Commons,.
Ottawa, March 7, 1902.
Sir,-I have already asked you several times for the dismissal of the postmaster of Joliette, Dr. J. J. Sheppard.
Our friends are complaining, with reason, of the conduct of Dr. Sheppard. He is an ardent Conservative who has continued to fight our friends. In spite of his position he exercises his influence in the city of Joliette, where he lives, and outside of it with his patients and friends.
During the elections of 1896 he compelled two persons to vote for the Conservative candidate, Mr. Belisle, whose wife was employed in the post office and Mr. Mireault, mail courier of Joliette.
During the elections of 1890 he exercised the same influence over Mr. Mireault and two of his sons who live with the latter. During the same elections again, with the intention of hurting the Liberals and helping the Conservatives, Dr. Sheppard detained illegally at his office letters which the committee of organization of the Liberal party addressed.to the political Liberal leaders of each parish ; amongst others, two letters addressed to political friends in two parishes requesting them to announce on Sunday after the service political meetings which the Liberal party was going to hold in these two parishes one day of the following week.
The consequence of this, was that I went to these two parishes with speakers to have the discussion and I found no one there, because the meetings had not been called for, the friends to whom I had addressed letters requesting them to call meetings could not hold them, not having received their letters.
I could bring to your attention a quantity of faults in the administration of the post office. Dr. Sheppard looks more after his medical practice than after his post office, where he gets young girls quite incompetent to replace him.
Therefore, in the interest of the public the removal of Dr. Sheppard from the postmaster-

It seems that a strike has taken place in the city of Halifax amongst a number of men employed in the shipping trade and the strike is one of very serious proportions. I have seen several references to the matter in the newspapers coming from that city and it seems that a sympathetic strike has been organized in connection with the strike of the longshoremen involving some 1,000 or 1,400 men. I suppose the government have had their attention called to the matter. I wish to know to what extent they have interposed, as I think it was their duty to interpose in connection with it. The matter is one of extreme importance to the port of Halifax which is very well known in this House and which is recognized by the whole Dominion as one of the most important ports of this Dominion-I would say the most important port that we have, taking it all the year round. This port is open all the year round, Mr. CASGRAIN.
it has great advantages not possessed by other ports although some of them, in other respects, are of greater importance. So that, the matter is not one of purely local interest, but it is of general interest, affecting the Dominion as a whole. I should like to know if the government can give us any information regarding this matter and if they can tell us whether any steps, and if so, what steps have been taken in connection with it.

The same day the Deputy Minister of Labour was sent from Ottawa to Halifax to lend his friendly offices in order to bring about a settlement and after an intervention extending over a little more than a day I am glad to say that he was able to bring both parties to an understanding and on the Saturday following the men returned to work. The strike had been in force a week or ten days, it involved some 600 or 700 longshoremen who were directly parties to it and who were directly concerned and several hundred other workmen who were described as sympathetic strikers went out on strike at the same time. I may also add that there was danger of the strike extending and including many others who, would most probably have taken part but have not done so. The arrangement come to was mutually satisfactory to the men, the companies and the merchants interested, was reduced to writing, agreed to by the men in meeting and signed by the companies and employers. I received a report from the Deputy Minister of Labour on the subject and I might trouble the House by reading the conclusion of it which will , perhaps more clearly dispose of the matter. After having arranged a mutual agreement between the parties it was necessary for him to bring it to the attention of the strikers in meeting, and to the attention of the companies. He proceeds to refer to the agreement in the following words :
After the terms of both agreements were read to the meeting a motion in favour of acceptance was carried without a dissenting voice, and the president and secretary of the Longshoremen's Association were authorized to sign' the agreements on its behalf. There were over 1,000 strikers present at this meeting. Motions were then carried, declaring the longshoremen's strike and the three sympathetic strikes at an end, and all agreed to return to work on the following morning. A noticeable feature of this meeting was the perfect order which prevailed throughout, and the unanimity which characterized the acceptance of all resolutions which were put to it. As evidence of the good feeling which appears to have resulted from the disposition on the part of the employers to negotiate in a friendly spirit with the men in arriving at the terms of agreement, I should possibly mention

that a proposal of cheers for the steamship agents and other employers, received as hearty a response as any other like proposals which followed the conclusion of this meeting.
The agreement itself is a somewhat lengthy document, and certain provisions in regard to the rates of wages and hours of labour, Sunday and holiday labour, work performed on stranded or wrecked vessels, and under other exceptional circumstances, as well as other conditions governing employment. The agreement also contains a clause intended to prevent the possible re-occurrence of a strike or lock-out, by requiring that 30 days notice in writing shall be given before any change in the terms of the agreement can be made by either party, and that no strike or lock-out shall be declared without 30 days' notice in writing.
On Saturday, the morning following the ratification of agreement at the mass meeting of strikers, the fish-handers, coal workers and coopers, concerned in the sympathetic strikes, resumed work, and work was recommenced along the wharfs by the longshoremen, at the docks where there was loading or unloading to be done.
I have every reason to believe that the settlement as arranged by this agreement has given mutual satisfaction to the parties interested, and that an immediate settlement of the strike has been of the very greatest importance to the commercial and other business Interests of the port of Halifax. Moreover, Judging from the nature of a number of interviews which I had with different persons, both employers and employees, subsequent to the settlement of the strike, concerning the prevention of possible future differences, I am led to believe that the principle of conciliation and arbitration has become more generally appreciated and is likely to play an increasingly important part in the future. As evidence of the appreciation of the services rendered through the good offices of the department under the Act, in regard to the present strike, I need only add that at the mass meeting of the strikers, called for the purpose of ratifying the agreement, the motion extending a vote of thanks to the department was carried unanimously, and with the very greatest enthusiasm, while the appended letter from the chairman of the committee of the steamship agents and merchants concerned, is sufficiently clear in its expression of their feelings in the matter.
Beard of Trade, Halifax, April 12, 1902.
W. I.. McKenzie King, Esq.,
Deputy Minister of Labour.
Dear Sir,-The steamship agents and the merchants of Halifax, concerned in the recent strike of the longshoremen, desire to place on record their appreciation of your services in arranging a settlement which has been accepted by both parties to the dispute. They feel that a prolongation of the trouble has been mainly averted by the tact, good judgment and impartiality shown by you, and in making this acknowledgment, believe that they are expressing the sentiments of the longshoremen as well as their own.
Yours truly,

The people of Canada, no doubt as well as the members of this House, will feel deeply grateful to the hon. member for Hants (Mr. Russell) for bringing up this important subject, and allowing the Minister of Labour such a favourable opportunity of telling us what we have been reading in the press for several days past. The whole little play reminds me of what we sometimes see in country newspapers where the townspeople are about to present a gentleman with an oil painting of himself, and the recipient of which expresses himself as being completely taken by surprise, yet makes a most appropriate and fitting reply. The Minister of Labour comes down here with a beautifully written document that has been prepared some time ago. Of course he is quite taken by surprise. But for the purpose of unloading that document upon this House and upon the country, he gets his handy mail of all work on that side of the House, to ask him a question.

This is what the Halifax ' Herald ' says, and it will be seen that it is a little more complimentary than the felicitous remarks of the hon. member for Grey (Mr. Sproule) : The longshoremen's strike is over to the great relief of all concerned. In bringing this about too high tribute cannot be paid to Mr. W. L. Mackenzie King, Deputy Minister of Labour. He arrived from Ottawa on Thursday evening, end in twenty-five hours had everything arranged. A 'Herald' reporter interviewed Mr. King at the Halifax hotel last evening after tile longshoremen's meeting. Mr. King was up to his eyes in business, and was besieged by those who were anxious to offer him congratulations. These included many who were prominent both among the employers of labour and in labour circles.
That is the opinion of that great organ of

tlie Conservative party on Mr. King and on what he did. The Halifax ' Herald ' continues :
A Personal Impression of the Deputy Minister of Labour.
Mr. King is a very young man to fill with such success the important position which is his. He may be thirty, but he does not look it. In countenance he is almost boyish, with nis smooth-shaven face and quick, alert movements. He is brimful of energy and enthusiasm. But the impression of youthfulness is dissipated after a few moments' conversation, for even the casual observer is impressed with thp fact that this is a man of affairs, level-headed and decisive.
That is the impression Mr. King leaves on the leading minds of the party opposite :
Mr. King believes the labour problem is the problem of the age, and is engrossed heart and soul in his work.
I wish hon. gentlemen opposite to listen to this with bated breath :
The impression he leaves Is that he is a fine combination of brains, energy and optimism- just the kind of man into whose hands the Lord gives the thing that needs to he done, and done swiftly. To such natures the world's work naturally comes.
I read that as showing two things. First, the appreciation which this organ of the great Conservative party has of the work done by Mr. King, and second, to congratulate the minister upon the settlement of that strike, notwithstanding the little play that the member for Grey sees in this matter. I congratulate the minister that a great strike of that kind was so speedily settled. Twenty-five hours was a very short time in which to arrive at a settlement. We haye been amply paid in the province of Nova Scotia for all the expenditure we have incurred in connection with that department. We should all lie very thankful. It is my opinion that very often the strikers a$ well as the employers are at fault in these matters, and so we have to congratulate ourselves that there are methods that can toe used to bring capital and labour together, and to enable them to get along in peace and harmony.

While we are all glad that this strike has been settled, we have no guarantee that other strikes may not crop up in different parts of the Dominion. Would it not be well for ns to consider the compulsory Arbitration Act passed in New Zealand and which constitutes a conciliation court presided over by a judge of the Supreme Court. The New Zealand Act has been adopted by the commonwealth of Australia, so that both these countries have a law for the compulsory settlement of strikes when they occur.

A very serious disturbance has not only been settled, but a more serious disturbance has been averted. I wish to take this opportunity to bring to the notice of the Minister of Labour, certain amendments to the Conciliation Act which I have on the Order paper, and I trust he will take them into consideration, because they are framed with the hope that they will extend the application of our Conciliation Act. In this case under discussion the prime credit for this settlement is due to the Longshoremen's Union, who telegraphed to Ottawa asking for conciliation. It is oftentimes considered a sign of weakness that either party to the strike should apply for conciliation, and for that reason both parties are often deterred from asking interference. The amendments) I have foreshadowed are calculated to get over that defect in the Act. When a serious dispute of this kind can toe settled, it points to us the reasonableness of trying to settle other disputes. Some of the most serious disputes we have had last year have not been shortened by one day because of the Conciliation Act. It is to try and increase the scope of that Act, that I would ask the Minister of Labour to help me to have my amendments adopted, especially now that he has evidence that a great deal of good can toe done to settle trade disputes by legislation in this parliament.

These men are obliged to work from half-past six in the morning to six at night with one hour for dinner, making ten and a half hours work instead of ten hours. Before any strike occurs it would be well that the minister should at once commission his deputy to interview the employers with the object of making the working day ten hours at most. As the Deputy Minister of Labour is rather busy at present, perhaps he might commence hist operations in the neighbourhood of Ottawa, and prevail on some of the saw-mill owners in this neighbourhood to reduce the hours of work of the men in the mills to those of men employed in other avocations, and then the same rule might he extended to other parts of the province.

The work is being continued on the same lines as hitherto, but is gradually increasing and expanding. Last year the vote taken did not quite cover the expenditure, and we found at the end of the year a number of accounts left over which had to be paid out of the vote for this year. The increased expenditure is due to the extension of the work, the greater calls upon the staff, and to some extent to increases in salaries and wages. The expense of living has increased in the country lately, and it has been found necessary also to give some recognition of the efficiency of men during a long period of service by an addition in some instances to their salaries and by increasing in general the pay of a good many of the staff.

The tables are given here, and show the quantity of milk given by each cow, both morning and evening, and the butter fat contained in the milk. Now to my mind this table shows nothing whatever, it proves nothing, although the statement is made that the result of this experiment seems to show a slight difference in favour of the dry feed. But in the one case the feed was given dry, and in the other case a different class of food was given wet. Now, we do not know whether the difference in results was owing to the moisture in the one case and to the dry character of the food in the other case, or to the different kinds of food. If the same kind of food had been used, in the one case dry and in the other case wet, then the results might be of some comparative value.

It appears somewhat strange to find that the crop measured exactly 120 tons. Then, taking the second crop, we find that there were twenty-one tons from twenty acres.

The report says that id addition to the above, 22 milch cows were pastured on the remaining 17 acres during two months, and the value is estimated at $2 per cow per month. There would not be much profit in the milk business if you had to pay $2 a month for the pasture of the cows. Nobody would think of paying that if we were compelled to rent the land.

I simply point this out because I think our reports ought to be reasonable, and 95 per cent of our farmers would say that this shows a very extraordinary state of things, not to be found in any other 200 acre farm in the country. I want to point out also that the horses and machinery are charged at $2.50 per day. Take the case of the hay crop. You must invest in a mower, a hay rake, a tedder, you must have a wagon, horses and harness, in fact, the whole outfit, and vet the hon. gentleman has charged up for all that $2.50 per day. Every farmer must know that that is below what it would cost, including the feed and the keeping up and maintaining of that machinery, paying a fair rate of interest on the purchase money, feeding the horses and caring for them. Everybody knows that that is not a reasonable price. That includes wear and tear and interest on the whole outfit. It seems to me that such highly

coloured statements are not useful in the country.

We find it more profitable to raise hay for stock instead of raising other crops. While we are on this subject, it may not be out of place for me to say something with regard to our system of farming in the county I represent. We have been using oxen for a long period and some use horses. But we find that the oxen are far more profitable, and for this reason: When you use a horse, you require a harness that will cost not less than $35 or $40, and which will not last a year in daily use without considerable repairing. But with oxen yoked at the head, two straps, at the cost of a dollar, which will last for years in daily use, is all that is required, to have the oxen do excellent work. Neck yoke is a thing of the past. We have made tests at exhibitions, and we find that an ox will haul 50 per cent more than a horse on a fair draft. I find it profitable to use oxen on a farm, and frequently have from four to seven yoke of oxen in daily use. We use them moderately and always keep them in perfect condition, so that if a butcher wants an ox, he goes to the man in charge and purchases at a fair rate. We find them profitable, but of course if you work your cattle from day to day and feed them scantily or perhaps overwork them, they will not be fit for butchers use. As a rule, an ox for work on the farm is far better than a horse, more steady, and will do the same amount of work and as I stated with less cost. We also find that oxen when yoked by the heads, will step as quickly as a pair of horses, particularly when they are managed by a skilful driver.

I grant if we were running a farm under ordinary circumstances, and not with a view to experiment, that could be accomplished by just taking the net profits at the end of the year, taking everything into consideration. But, in such an establishment as this it seems to me that the only way we can do is to say that there are 200 acres divided into so many fields of 37 acres, or 40 acres, 38 acres, or whatever it may be, that on that land so much crop was raised, that that crop cost so much, and in that case the land must be credited with it. When we come to work in the barn we have to feed that crop to the animals and we have to charge the value of the feed which is given to each of the individual animals. The aggregate of that is the result of using the whole of that crop. Then the product of the animal, either in milk or beef, or in other things, is credited to the feed and a balance again is struck to see whether there has been a profit or a loss. In the working of the experimental farm I understand that the work of the teams is charged at so much. If the hon. gentleman (Mr. Clancy) will notice, I think it is charged at $2.50 a day.

The MINISTER OF AGRlCuLTLRE. I wrould like to finish what I am saying. In that is included the cost of the maintenance of these teams. Part of the feed which has been got off that land has to be fed to these teams, and they are credited with the work they do. We value a day's work at $2.50 and there are the man's wages besides. That is credited to a certain part of the whole crop which is raised on the farm. A certain portion of the feed is fed to the bulls which give no return beyond a little service fee, to the pigs, the sheep, and so on. It is not all fed to the animals which are under experiment. Part of it is fed to the animals which are not under experiment, but which we keep as an illustration of the different breeds of animals for the benefit of visitors to the farm.

They must be charged, In a fair proportion, to all the fields during the year, because these are not hired teams that are brought in for a day's work. These horses are kept, some of them die, they grow old, the machinery wears out, and yet the hon. gentleman charges just for the day in which he employs them. No farmer would say that that would be a fair charge. The returns, so far as this is concerned, I venture to think, are entirely misleading. I am sure they do not appeal to any farmer in the House as being anything within near range of being accurate. I want to ask the hon. gentleman to follow this up. Taking the first field here, would he be able to show what has become of these 30 tons of straw charged up to four teams. Would he be able to say where it has gone, what account it is charged to, and if it is to be consumed, how much of it has been consumed, and how much of it is on hand ? Then, take again the next field, where 510 tons of ensilage is produced and see where that ensilage has been accounted for. 1 will take the next field, where there are 160 tons of ensilage. Where has that been accounted for ? If we do not attempt to account for feed of that kind under the same service, then I venture to say that this calculation is entirely without value. If such an account has been kept and worked out, then, I could understand the utility of it. But, the hon. Minister of Agriculture knows much better than I can tell him, that the charges that are made here are not such charges as would be made in actual farming. While the hon. gentleman says that it runs into the experimental portion as well as into the profitable portion, I admit that there would be some difficulty, but not an insuperable difficulty, in keeping them apart. I could connect the experimental portion with the feeding of stock. If the hon. gentleman's statements are to be accepted the experiments in the feeding of stock are profitable. These are just the expenditures incurred in the growing of grain on the 200 acres, or of crops generally and which, as well as the feeding of the stock, include labour and everything else involving a larger amount of charge against the farm. It seems to me that the hon. gentleman ought to undertake to give to this committee, at some future period, a statement of how the farm stands, and he should also recognize that the expense should be charged to the experimental portion of the work. I will venture to say that if the hon. gentleman reverses this method of keeping the accounts on the books, he will find the experiments making a profit and the farm going behind, because, if he charges the experiments with the day's work of the men, horses and machinery, he wil simply reverse the state of things. I desire to point that out to. show that these accounts, on the face of them, are misleading.

But, at the experimental farm, as a general rule, the teams are standing very little in the barn. Of course, in the summer time during wet days they must be in the barn, but during the winter time, when they would be standing in the barn on an ordinary farm, they are hauling manure for the experimental part of the farm and the horticultural work and that work has nothing to do with this 200-acre part of the farm. The men are utilized during bad weather from year's end to year's end in preparing grain for seed distribution, in preparing grain for exhibition work, and things of that kind, perhaps a little outside of the routine work of the farm, but still work that has to be done, and which is paid for out of the grain distribution apportionment of the farm and by the vote for exhibition purposes. If I secure agricultural specimens at the experimental farm, for sending to the exhibitions, every hours work of the men upon that, is paid out of the exhibition vote. That work is done at odd times when the men would possibly be idle otherwise. We have an immense amount of cleaning of grain for the seed distribution, which is done during the winter months. We have the threshing of all the experimental plots. That grain has to be kept carefully separate so that we may be able to find out the result. That takes hours, days, weeks, and

even months, for some men during the winter. All the men can be turned on to that work when there is bad weather and when they cannot work outdoors. There is no loss of time of the men on the farm and very little loss of time of the teams. Although this 200 acres is more than half the land cultivated on the farm, it is cultivated much more easily than the experimental plot work which takes a great deal more time, labour and expense, and the crop of which is not expected to pay ; the returns from it being its utility to the farmers of the country. X cannot give the statement which the hon. gentleman desires for last years work, but I will try to have it incorporated in the next annual report so that the gross sales and the actual cost of working that part of the farm may appear in the report.

I still have that sympathy, for I believe them to be one of the most if not the most important class of workers we have. But I think it well for us to examine these estimates a little closely. At page 35, I find such items as these :	Aid to agricultural societies $7,000 ; experimental farms $ SO,000 ; printing and distribution of reports and bulletins of farms $4,000 ; fumigating stations $3,000 ; for renewing and improving Canadian exhibit at Imperial Institute, London, $3,000 ; to promote dairying interests, etc. $40,000. And on page 36 ; I find cattle quarantines and veterinary divisions $7,000. Then at page 74 there is an item to meet expenditure under the Adulteration of Pood and Fertilizers Act $25,000, of which $12,000 would probably apply to the Agricultural Department. I have given oply a few items, yet we find here a total of $434,000 which is, in effect a direct bonus to the farmers of this country. This is a class of protection which these gentlemen probably do not recognize that they receive. Nevertheless, it is a direct bonus and a protection to them. This does not cover all, for there are such items as cattle inspection, $2,800 ; protection for timber planting in the west,-designed to afford shelter and to help in retaining the moisture precipitated- $15,000, running the amount up to $450,000, without including the salary of an expensive minister. If you include this and other items it will easily amount to $500,000. We have heard it stated a good many times on the floor of this House that the farmers have no protection. As a manufacturer, i claim that the farmers have protection in these items amounting to $500,000. The claim is made that the farmers were called upon to pay duties on the importation last year of $1,927,000 worth of agricultural implements. But this bonus given outright to the farmers would more than pay the duty on all the agricultural implements imported last year. And this does not cover it all either. If we consider the Glasgow exhibition, the Paris exposition, the Pan-American and others, which cost this country a large amount of money, we find that that money is laid out for the benefit of the industrial portion of the community and largely for the benefit of the farming class.
There are some other advantages that the farmers get, and for which they do not perhaps pay their proportion of the cost.
I would not have the House imagine that I am objecting to these amounts, nor am I objecting to the item I propose to speak of just now, that is the postal service. The Postmaster General's Report will show that the postal service of the country districts is not self-sustaining, that the large centres of population undoubtedly have to pay for it. That report will show to any reasonable mind that the people in the country districts to-day are paying more for their postage than they ever paid in the history of the country. They are not paying it directly in the way of postage, but indirectly in other forms of taxation. Every one knows that the large corporations, the insurance companies and others, having a large amount of mailing matter, are receiving great advantage from the change in the postage. Personally, I have no doubt that the change benefits the firm with which I am connected at least $150 a year. But if we save $150, some one else has to pay it; it may not be paid in postage, but it is paid in taxation, and that is largely borne by the farmers of the country.
Then they have other advantages as well. We have expended millions of dollars on transportation, very largely in the interest

of the farmers. Our great railways have been built mostly for that purpose, and our canal systems have been built and will be enlarged in the future on the same basis. So that they have not only this direct bonus of $500,000, but they have these other advantages from which they are constantly receiving benefit. In this year's estimates the improvements to harbours will cover a very large amount, directly to the advantage of the farmers. Why are we spending money at Collingwood, at Owen Sound, at Depot Harbour, at Goderich ? Simply in order to afford better facilities for the transportation of the products of the farm. We are spending in dredging harbours, also in the interest of better transportation, a sum of oyer $600,000. Then in steamship subventions the farmers have an advantage. So that in addition to the protection the farmers have in the tariff on wheat, flour and such products, they have all these other advantages as well. There is also another scheme that may come to the front. Why is the building of the Georgian Bay canal mooted at all ? That is not for the benefit of the manufacturers, by whom the Minister of Trade and Commerce used to say that the country was being bled white, but in the interest of the farming community of the west; and if it is ever built it will be built in their interest alone. The criticisms from this side of the House are in a fair spirit, they are not against these grants themselves, but in tiie mode of their expenditure. We desire that the farmers of this country may get all the advantage xjossible for the amount of money that is being expended. That is the object of all the criticisms made in this House by the opposition. We do not object so much to the expenditure, but we believe that the farmers and others are not getting a fair equivalent for their money. We are told that the farmers have no protection, but that the manufacturers are getting all the advantages. The Minister of Trade and Commerce has in years past rather abused the guild to which I have the honour to belong. I say we have as honourable men in it as the hon. gentleman who occupies the position of Minister of Trade and Commerce. We have not in it men who have tied up water powers and are refusing to sell them when they are needed for the development of the country. We have not men who have decried cabinet positions and afterwards accepted $7,000 a year of the people's money to fill those positions.
I resent the statement the hon. member has made in so far as the manufacturers of this country are concerned. I think the grants that are before us to-day are all right in themselves, but I want an assurance from the minister that they will be expended in the best possible manner in the interest of the farmers.

Minister of Agriculture to-night that they have not had an opportunity of getting before. But, what astonishes me is, to hear members of this House getting up and deploring the work that the hon. minister is trying to do for the farmers. They appear to complain because he is protecting the farmers, because he is assisting them in the matter of transportation and experimental farms and trying to improve in other ways the work of the farmer. I think if the lion. Minister of Agriculture devotes his time to that work he will be doing a grand thing for this country and when we speak about that as being protection to the farmers I would say that it is an excellent thing that he is protecting the farmers in that way. The farmer has to pay for his clothing a protection to the manufacturer of about 30 per cent. That is $30 on the hundred added to the expense of maintaining his family, which goes to the manufacturer of clothing. If he consumes confectionery he has to pay 25 cents on the dollar and if he consumes biscuits he has to pay 27 cents on the dollar.

We were innocent enough to believe that when a proposal for the expenditure of public money is before the House it is our duty to ascertain in what way the money is being silent and to bring out such information as will enable us to determine whether it is a wise expenditure or not. It is not a discussion but rather more in the nature of asking questions, which it is legitimate and proper for us to do. It is not a question of whether the party who is asking the questions knows anything about the business or not. There are experiments being carried on at the farm. It is our duty to ascertain as far as possible, whether they are being conducted on proper lines and what the results of these experiments have beeu. If they have not been conducted on proper lines it is our place to offer such suggestions as in our judgment might be of assistance to -those engaged in them. It is for the purpose of bringing out this information that these questions are being asked. In connection with these experiments I want to say a few words on another line. Experiments have been carried on for some time in regard to the feeding of pork to determinate what class of foods produce soft pork. I listened with a great deal of interest to the statement of Mr. Shutt of the experimental farm when he was before the Committee on Agriculture to give information upon that question. My understanding, before the experiment was commenced was, that it was to be carried on for the purpose of determining what classes of food were the most suitable for producing a good quality of pork, but it seems to me that the whole sheet was made out with the aim of determining whether corn produces soft pork or not and it had very little relevancy to the question of determining the effect of other kinds of food. Those who are in the habit of raising pork know that there are certain kinds of food which will produce soft pork and that some food prepared in different ways produces different qualities of pork. I think that experiment fell far short of what it should have been to bring ..out information that should have been available to the farmers of the country. In'all the combinations of food that were made in the course of the experiment corn was one-half of each ration. If half was made up of different things like mangolds, turnips, oats, and barley ; while it might be proper to use corn ns one of the rations it was at least

equally valuable to determine what were the cheapest possible kinds of feed we could use to produce good pork. In my section of the country the principle feed used is mangolds, beets or turnips, with pease, oats and barley ground up and put over it. There is a great deal of difference in the quality of pork produced from feeding raw turnips and from feeding boiled turnips. There has been no sufficient inquiry into the results obtained from such feed as that.

If you can produce as good a quality of pork from sugar beets and a small quantity of grain, as you can from an entire ration of grain, then you will have a larger profit because roots are cheaper than grain. We had practically no information along that line in the committee. If you can convince a farmer that he can use feed which costs him only one cent a pound or less, and four pounds of which will make a pound of pork which he can sell for 6 cents, you will show him how to make a profit. If grain is high in price it is not profitable to feed it to hogs. In this respect the experiments were deficient. Now, we have had no information given us as to the yield on that part of the farm which was cultivated for the purpose of showing how much profit there was in agriculture, and we were not told how much manure was put on these fields year after year.

For example, I had unwillingly to take a farm which came into my hands that had been exhausted of all fertility. My desire was to have it restored, and to accomplish that end, I went to the experimental farm to inquire what would be the best method to bring the soil back to its virgin condition. I was advised to take a sub-soil plough very early in the spring and turn up the bottom earth. The inquiry was made of me, what did the soil consist of ? I said that it was a red clay covered with a black light loam, which, from having been cropped frequently, was exhausted of all its properties, and grew very little more than carraway, witch grass and weeds. I followed the advice given to me by the experimental farm people and, after having turned up the sub-soil as advised with a good sub-soil plough, I was advised to sow it with clover seed thick, enough to produce a good thick crop. After the clover had grown about six inches, I had it turned under by shallow ploughing ; and then sowed the land with oats, timothy and clover, and had an excellent crop that season, coming in about the month of August, which was cut for food, stored away in the barn, and fed to the stock ; and the next year I had the manure from that stock used as a top dressing. I treated

five acres the first year in this way and five acres the next year; and, after applying that method for five or six years, I had an immense yield of good, wholesome food. That farm only kept four head of cattle at first, but now it has thirty-six head on about sixty acres of land, half of which is In pasture. Therefore, I say that farming, if conducted in a proper manner, will give a handsome living to the farmer. A farmer,
I contend, is a king among peasants. Now, as tlie hon. member for East Grey (Mr. Sproule) has referred to hog raising, I may ' say that I made inquiry on that subject at the experimental farm, and was advised to feed hogs on clover and sugar beets. I received that same advice from other parties, and was also advised to use the sugar beet for horned cattle. The clover and the sugar beet, put into a vat and boiled up together, along with some middlings, pease, beans or any thing of that kind, gave an excellent food for hogs ; and as a result I had an excellent herd of hogs raised principally on this description of food. I imported eleven, out of which I had a product of 101, and from that product I netted in one year, from November to November, a clear profit of $1,000.

X sold the whole of the young stock, weighing about 250 pounds a piece. I sold them without any difficulty right at my door in the town where I live, for seven and eight cents per pound dressed) weight, and 1 could not give them to the butchers as fast as they were applying for them. The farm had all the trimmings. I employed a party at $14 a month to do nothing but look after the hogs. I gave him his house rent free, all the roots he required for his family, ail his firewood and other small perquisites, and I found that it was the most profitable investment I had on the farm. I had an orchard on the farm, and when there was a little breeze some of the apples fell which used to be picked up by hand ; now the hogs are turned in and they pick up the apples without any trouble, and which is good food for them. After the hogs picked up>
the apples they are sent back to the pen.
This year I only have half the number, because my men had to give their attention to other work, but I advise every farmer to grow pork and use the methods I employ, namely, feed with young clover and the sugar beet. The sugar beet will be far better employed in Canada in the feeding of stock than in the production of sugar. We have had experience in the manufacture
of sugar from the beet, which has shown to be an utter failure, and with all due deference to my hon. friend from Grey (Mr. Sproule), I believe that if we would give our attention to the growth of the sugar beet and use it in the way I mention, we would have much better returns than we could possibly have by converting it into sugar. Might I ask the hon. minister if any experiments have been made with regard to the destruction of the cattle fly. Our cattle in the maritime provinces are greatly tormented by that pest, and we have used in a rude way every method we could devise to get rid of it. We have applied the fish oil and paraffine-a very slight mixture of paraffine with the fish oil-every day to the cattle, and some of our people have tied rugs about the horns to protect them. That latter precaution, however, is an inconvenience to the cattle, as it makes them too warm in the summer season. If the hon. gentleman knows of any method for getting rid of this pest, I would be very glad to have the information.

There was a vessel belonging to Lunenburg that went to Boston and was discharging and taking in cargo within a short distance of the contagious hospital there. The crew, it is reported, were not on shore, but the steward, through flies in the galley, became infected with small-pox. The vessel left on her voyage to Georgetown, Prince Edward Island. Arriving there the captain reported the steward sick, feeling that the disease was of a serious character. The doctor went on board and pronounced it small-pox, and advised the captain that he and the crew should remain isolated, and not leave the ship. After a day or two's delay, the doctor informed the captain that he with his ship ' Monitor ' was to proceed to Pictou. The vessel proceeded to Pictou under difficulty, going out in a storm. Reaching the port of Pictou. the captain reported himself through the captain of another vessel. and remained in quarantine waters. After two or three days delay at Pictou, this poor man suffering from this terrible disease, without the necessary treatment, the vessel was ordered to Charlottetown across the bay. What I contend is that this poor man should have had medical treat-Hon. Mr. FISHER.
ment during all this time. When the vessel reached Charlottetown, it was after a lapse of six or seven days from the time it had arrived at Georgetown. The sick man was landed, but had been on shore hardly any time when he died. The captain reported to me that it was through the want of proper attention shown by the customs or quarantine official at Georgetown, that the poor man met his death, and the itnneeessary detention of the ship in Georgetown and Pictou. It appears that, under the Act, the customs official becomes the quarantine agent when a vessel with sickness aboard is reported. The vessel was kept in quarantine at a late season of the year, after she should have been out of the gulf, the gulf being prohibited waters. She was paying a percentage to go into the gulf, intending to have carried a chartered cargo from Georgetown, and if that vessel had been looked after quickly, she would have been out of the gulf and out of quarantine in time to have completed her charter. But, leaving the port in which the ship was quarantined, then being released, and going into the gulf in a storm and trying to make Pictou harbour in a snow storm for shelter in the night, she met with shipwreck. The vessel, which was a new one, just launched the year previous and specially built of special material for a certain purpose, was lost to the owners, and the crew barely saved their lives. The vessel was -sold as a derelict and was bought in by other parties. I would ask the minister to look into this matter carefully and give such satisfaction as is within his power. I will write him a carefully drawn letter giving the facts, to which I will ask his careful attention that he may give me Information as to the position in which this poor unfortunate master and owners are to be placed. The vessel was worth $7,000. The captain is deprived of his season's work, which was his living. All he asks now is not the value of the ship, but, in consequenece of the want of proper attention on the part of the custom officials at the quarantine station at Georgetown, that the captain and owners should be compensated to the extent of the charter which would be about $600 or $700-I can give the exact amount by referring to a letter written to me by the master.

I know the case quite well. The vessel arrived at Georgetown. I do not remember where she came from, but it was at Georgetown she first came into contact with Canadian officials. But my department did not hear anything of her until she arrived at Pictou. I have not the .official statement, but I understand that the provincial health authorities at Georgetown ordered the vessel away. Georgetown is not an organized quarantine port. Nor is Pictou, though it used to be three or four years ago. I sup-

pose the health authorities at Georgetown ordered her to Pictou on the supposition that it was still an organized quarantine port. Charlottetown is an organized quarantine port and was the proper place for her to go to with a quarantinable disease aboard. The moment we heard of her being in Pictou, she was ordered to proceed to Charlottetown, which would take but a few hours. The case was attended to by the quarantine officer there in due course. The quarantine law had to be carried out, and neither the government nor the department can be held responsible for damages accruing in carrying out the law, which is for the protection of the whole people against disease coming from abroad. The course of the department in taking the vessel from Pictou, a nonorganized port, to Charlottetown, an organized port, was quite in accord with the necessities of the case and with the law. It was extremely unfortunate, no doubt, that the man died in the quarantine at Charlottetown. Whether that death was in any way due to the voyage from Georgetown via Pictou to Charlottetown, we have no means of knowing. The man had every care and attention in the quarantine hospital at Charlottetown, but unfortunately he died a few days afterwards. The vessel had to be quarantined and disinfected, and the people who were on board the vessel and had been exposed to contagion, had to be kept in quarantine until the period of the incubation of the disease was over.

Then he would have been advised that she could not be received at Pictou, but must go to Charlottetown. I think it is clear that this man neglected his duty. I may be wrong, but I understand that the customs official in Georgetown becomes the quarantine officer for the time being in cases such as that. He leaves off his official position as customs official, and becomes quarantine official. But I contend that the quarantine official should have communicated at once with Pictou by wire, because the life of that man depended upon all despatch being used and the shortest time employed to get him off the Ship and under medical treatment. And finding that Pictou could not receive him, the vessel could then have gone direct to Charlottetown ; she would have been running on one side of the triangle, whereas she had to make three sides by sailing first to Pictou and then to Charlottetown.

It is true that at Georgetown there is no quarantine hospital, but when a ship arrives the customs officer sees-that a doctor is sent on board. The doctor was acting under the authority of the Dominion government, and the customs officer at that port was also an official of the Dominion government. There was a case of small-pox, and they had no means of taking charge of this sick seaman at that time, and I do not know for what reason they did not communicate directly with the De-partmet of Public Health at Ottawa. Instead of doing so they ordered this vessel away from Georgetown to Pictou. I cannot understand why such a proceeding was allowed to take place. This vessel having a case of small-pox on board, was ordered from Georgetown to the port of Pictou in Nova Scotia, simply because the vessel hailed from a port of Nova Scotia. Now, we are all Canadians, and there is no reason why this poor sick seaman should have been dragged about from one port to another. Arriving at Pictou, the vessel was ordered back again to Charlottetown, where there was a quarantine hospital. I say it was a case of gross inhumanity, and was so^ regarded by the people of the maritime provinces, that this poor man should have been carried around in this vessel for seven or eight days without medical treatment, when he was paying into the government his sick, mariner's fees. Certainly there was neglect somewhere. The poor man went into the quarantine hospital at Charlottetown and died there, in fact, he was so near dead, when he landed that he only survived a few hours. You will understand that the merchants of Prince Edward Island chai'ter these vessels from the province of Nova Scotia to carry away produce in the fall of the year, and it is important that these vessels should come freely into our ports for the purpose of carrying away cargoes. Another case of small-pox occurred, and this-time, notwithstanding the experience of the former case, the vessel was boarded by the customs officer, a doctor diagnosed that sick seaman's case, and then he was taken in a vehicle and driven from Georgetown to Charlottetown, a distance of thirty miles, through the country, exposing to contagion the people all along the route. No attempt whatever was made to warn the people of their danger. I have no doubt the minister is conscientious in this matter, but I want to impress upon him the need of taking precautions in cases of this kind where the public health of so many people is exposed to danger. There should be some provision made at a port like Georgetown, some kind

of a temporary hospital outside the limits of the town, where cases of this kind can be attended to by doctors and nurses.

He did not quote them with absolute accuracy. I am referring now to the unrevised version of ' Hansard.' For instance, the figures for 1897 were quoted by the Minister of Trade and Commerce, who substituted 4,875,005 for the correct_ figures in the Year-book which are 4,875.035. It is not an important error, but it shows that there was not absolute accuracy in quoting the figures. The first occasion on which

that hon. gentleman referred to the figures, he gave the estimate as not 4,875,035, but 4,856,236, and so on throughout. Whether there was carelessness in transcribing or not I cannot say, but the figures were not presented to the House absolutely as they are in the Year-book.

Now, how could any man rationally say that the Year-book of 1889 suppressed the figures of the two following years ? Evidently there was some great confusion of ideas on the part of the gentleman who made the charge. He goes on to say that he will supplement these figures, and he does it, not by quoting from the volume of 1890, where he would have found the estimates for that year ; but supplying an estimate on his own authority while giving the Year-book as his authority. He gave 5,210,000 for 1890, whereas the Year-book gives 5,189,099, and for 1891 he supplied the estimate of 5,345,000, where the Year-book contains the actual figures^ of the census of that year, namely, 4,843,256.

haye already attempted to make that correction in the House, and I am precluded from doing so by the rules of the House. I am not doing that now. I am merely quoting the figures of the Year-book to show that the statement to the effect that this volume is inaccurate was thrown out I think too hastily. That statement was based on the fact that the estimated population of Canada did not turn out to be the correct population when the census figures were obtained. That could scarcely be hoped for. The Year-book does not publish, and never has published, these figures as being absolutely correct, but always as estimated ; and in order to avoid any misleading impression, the Year-book states as follows :
No information is available for ascertaining the increase of population since 1881 (except as above mentioned), with any great practical accuracy. The population used in different parts-of this work is derived from logarithmetical calculations based on census returns, and is believed to be sufficiently near the mark to be of value in the calculations for which it is used ; but it will be readily understood that from the absence of returns of births and deaths and from the incessant movement of population, both ways, across the long frontier, of which it is impossible to keep any record, it is impossible to obtain any absolutely correct statement of the population between census years:
The Year-book in making that careful provision has certainly prevented the estimated figures being the occasion of any error, and I may say that there is no other way in which this House or the departments could have the advantage of knowing what the population of Canada is in any particular year, except by using an estimate made up in this particular way. I would like to call the attention of the committee to the fact that this system is not peculiar to Canada, but that the same system is adopted in the official figures used in all countries. I quote from the Statesman's Year-book of 1892, to show that the system followed in Canada is followed in that publication. It says :
The registrar general's estimate of the population in the middle of each year is based on tho assumption that the rate of increase which prevailed in the intercensal period immediately preceding has since been maintained.
In making up these figures, we have to assume that the census returns are correct, and that the annual increase of population shown by the census returns is correct; and, using these two factors, by a purely mathematical calculation, an estimate is made each year of the population of Canada. While that is certainly liable not to be correct, still it is apparently made with every degree of honesty, without any intention to deceive, and is approximately correct; and I am sure that the minister, when he looks into the matter more fully, will find that he has nothing to apologize for so far as this publication issued under the authority of his department, is concerned. As the

figures are not represented to be tlie actual figures, but merely estimated figures, and as they are prepared by a system of logarithmic calculation, which excludes any idea of motive in their preparation, they are the same as any official would have to supply in making up these returns., I would not have made these remarks but that the minister last night seemed disposed to admit that there was an error in the calculation, which is not the case.

In his defence lie distinctly admitted the offence. When the occurrence first took place, Dr. Monti-zambert was in England attending the tuberculosis convention, and I was also away at the moment for a short time. The gravamen of the offence was his going away from duty without permission, and his making misrepresentations to the head of the quarantine service at Halifax in regard to certain repairs which were being made to the boiler of the ship of which he was captain, the result being that boat was laid up for two weeks sooner than there was any need for, and the department had to hire another boat to take her place. These accusations were submitted to Capt. Stewart, and lie was given an opportunity to reply to them. It was clear from his own reply and from the evidence we obtained in regard to the matter, that he had been neglectful of his duty in being away without leave, and also that he had made misrepresentations, causing the laying up of the vessel. Under these circumstances, I did not see how it was possible to maintain the discipline of the establishment if I allowed him to remain in the service.

service-I understand upwards of twenty years-and I am not aware that any charge of any kind was ever made against him before. I took the liberty of asking the hon. member for Victoria, N.S., (Mr. Ross), who, when collector of customs at the port of Halifax, was the chief of this officer for a number of years, and he told me that, while in his department and under his control, Captain Stewart was a most faithful, zealous and efficient officer. And I have no doubt my hon. friend would repeat his statement were he here to-night. The charges against Captain Stewart were made by his superior officer, Dr. Maekay. Dr. Mackay charges him, in the first place, with having on the 24th of July, left the city between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning, without permission, and with having gone out on the St. Margaret's Bay road on a spree, and remained away all afternoon. Captain Stewart absolutely and specifically denies this charge. He says that no vessel was expected and that, although he did go for a drive, during an hour or two, on the St. Margaret's Bay road, he had made provision so that in his absence there could be no detriment to the public service in case any vessel should be sighted. In the next place Dr. Mackay charges him with not having been on duty when the steamship ' Nassovia ' arrived from Stellin, for coal. Captain Stewart explains that Dr. Jones, the quarantine officer, boarded that vessel at seven in the morning, and that no delay whatever occurred in connection with the quarantine service, and in verification of that statement he referred the department to Dr. Jones himself, who is a well known physician in the city of Halifax, an officer of the department, and whose statement, I believe, would verify that of Captain Stewart. Captain Stewart is also charged by Dr. Mackay :
That in the afternoon of the 25th of July, the steamship 'Ulunda' arrived from Liverpool and steamed up the harbour with her quarantine signal flying and there was no word from you of her coming. Dr.. Mackay states he saw the quarantine signal on the 'Citadel' and called up his office four different times to ascertain f there was any word from you about the arrival of a vessel and always received a negative reply.
Captain Stewart replied :
When the steamship was coming up the harbour I called up- Dr. Maekay's house several times and could get no answer. After trying for some time without hearing from him, I then called up Dr. Jones, and was informed at his house that he was off duty attending the reception of Lord Minto, and Dr. Mackay knew it. After looking around the town, I went to the steamer and found that Dr. Mackay had been there ; 1 did not think the circumstance very remarkable, as I have frequently known Dr. Mackay to he an hour or so late getting to ships. I may say in this connection, as illustrating Dr. Mackay's anxiety to attend ships promptly that on the 9th August, the ss. 'Da-mara ' arrived from England at 11.40 ; it being Dr. Jones' turn and he being away I called Dr.

Mackay who was in bed and he refused to go to her, telling me to let her stay till Dr. Jones got home; he got home at 1 o'clock and went and cleared the ship.
There seems to be no contradiction of that statement in the papers, and it appears that this gentleman who made the charge against Captain Stewart was willing to allow the vessel to remain in quarantine for hours because it was not convenient for him to attend to it. With respect to the statement of the hon. minister that Captain Sewart misrepresented the circumstances with regard to the condition of the boiler on the ' Argus,' Captain Stewart's statement is as follows :
I beg to make a general and explicit denial. I could have no object in pursuing the course with which he charges me: he knew and we all knew that tile work had to be done, that Mr. Dodwell ordered it to be done, and that Messrs. Ferguson & Cox had the contract ; it could not be done without the boat laying up. She was there in the hands of the contractors with whom I 1 ad no interest in any way, and whether they were a short time or a long time doing the work was a matter oyer which I had no control, and certainly I had no interest in making any misrepresentations to Dr. Mackay or anybody else about it. He charges me with refusing to answer a letter he wrote asking for explanation' of the work : This charge is not true, I immediately went to him making verbal statement of the condition of the work ; having done so, I did not think it necessary to write hiro a formal letter on the subject which seems to be the essence of his complaint. In connection with Dr. Mackay's charges against me he makes several statements that are not in accordance with the facts; for instance ho says that I told him positively that the boiler uas finished at a certain date, with the exccp-ion of making a few holes. I never told him anything of the sort, I knew the boiler was not finished, and I never told him that it should take so many days to do any part df the work. I could not say anything about such work as it is altogether out of my line, and it would be absurd to suppose that I would be undertaking to give opinions or statements with regard to the same. If Dr. Mackay was very anxious to know about the progress of the work, he should have consulted the contractors or asked Mr. Case, the engineer, whose opinion would he worth something as it was directly in his line.
I have thus answered categorically the several charges which Dr. Macltay has laid against me in the discharge of my official duties, and will now refer the matter in connection therewith.
Captain Stewart says further :
After about sixteen years of official service under the government both in customs and quarantine, I beg to say that Dr. Mackay is the only man who has ever made rhe complaint against me during all that time. Dr. Mackay is a difficult man r.o get along with as everybody knows. I have do hesitation in referring to Dr. Jones with the utmost confidence that he will give me a certificate of character as a zealous and faithful officer as I have always tried to be.
Dr. Jones, to whom he refers is a warm supporter of the present government, a man who is well known and highly respect-Mr. BORDEN (Halifax).
ed in the city of Halifax, and I would like to know from the hon. minister whether he has any7 statement from Dr. Jones that in any way corroborates tbe charge of Dr. Mackay that Captain Stewart was at any time guilty of any dereliction of duty in the public service ?
There is another circumstance which seems to place this matter in not a very favourable light, from the standpoint of fair-play. Captain Stewart had sixteen years of good aud faithful sendee to his credit, without a single mark or charge against him up to this time. It is quite true, and I think I may say, without reflecting in any way on Dr. Mackay, that that gentleman is not a particularly easy person to get along with. Any one who knows him and is acquainted with his disposition, knows that he is sometimes a very difficult man to please indeed. Would it not have been fair for the hon. minister, under the circumstances, having this positive and categorical denial of all the charges, to have allowed Captain Stewart to bring evidence in support of tbe statements he made and to be confronted with tbe man who made tbe charges against him to have these charges determined by some impartial tribunal, with the right on both sides to call, and cross-examine witnesses, and thus be given that fair-play to which any man is entitled in respect of liis property and character in this country- the right to have a charge against him determined by an impartial tribunal in bis presence. But that is not the course which my hon. friend has pursued. It is true that Captain Stewart admits that he went out driving on Margaret's Bay road, but surely for a trivial offence of that kind-if it can be called an offence, which I doubt-after sixteen years faithful service, the Minister of Agriculture ought not to have dismissed an official of this kind. If he were to follow that line of conduct, there are very few officials in his department who would not be subject to instant dismissal, and I am sure that if he tested Dr. Mackay-and I am speaking not without the book in this connection-by that same measure, he would have been compelled to dismiss that gentleman long ago.
The Minister of Agriculture should reconsider this matter. He has dismissed this man without investigation, and on the statement of Dr. Mackay, which is absolutely disputed by Captain Stewart, except In the one respect I have mentioned, the trifling matter of taking a drive of two or three hours out St. Margaret's Bay Koad. But that was taken after precautions that the public interests should not suffer. Surely, on facts of that kind a man is not to be dismissed from tbe public service. Every charge made by Dr. Mackay is met with an exact and categorical denial. And what I say is that the Minister of Agriculture should have some regard to the statement made four or five years ago by tbe Prime Minis-

ter that no man against whom a charge is made should be dismissed without an investigation. Here is a man who seems to have been dismissed without an investigation. He has been in the public service sixteen years, and after giving his work to the country for that time, he is thrown out upon the world without the means of livelihood, no investigation having been held, and no opportunity afforded him of confronting his accusers or of calling witnesses on his own behalf.
There is another circumstance about it which is of an extremely harsh character, and that is that notwithstanding all that this man has paid into the superannuation fund for a number of years, he is absolutely unable to get the slightest satisfaction from the department as to whether any portion of the money paid will be refunded. Does the government propose to keep the money taken from an official in that way V Will the hon. minister add to the consolidated revenue of this country the few dollars which are nothing to the public, but which mean a great deal to this man ? Among the correspondence, 1 have statements showing some of the payments he has made. And it seems to me that the minister has not only treated this man with harshness in dismissing him, but with absolute indifference ever since on the question of these payments. Without casting any reflection upon any official of the department, I may say that the department did not seem to know, for months after Captain Stewart had sent in his denial of these charges, that he had written a letter on the subject at all. On the 13th August, Captain Stewart made his answers to the charges. On the. 5th of September he received a letter from the department stating that on the 10th of August he had been written to by the department, but no answer had been received. Ou the very day he received this letter he sent a telegram :
Replied to letter August 10th on 13th. Will mail copy to you at once.
The 13th would be the day when, in ordinary course of mail, he would receive the letter of August 10th. On the 7th September he received a letter asking why he did not answer the charges. On the same day he received that letter, he telegraphed to the department and also wrote. So far as the correspondence is concerned-if that is any indication of Captain Stewart's conduct as a public servant-he seems to have been up to the mark and to have conducted it in at least as businesslike a way as the department did. On the 16th September he communicated with the department on the question of whether an investigation would be granted or what course would be pursued. The next he heard in relation to this matter was on the 27th November, 1901, when lie was coolly informed that, without an investigation, he had been dismissed. And, according to the Order in Council he was dismissed for ' neglect of duty and misconduct and in the interest of the public service.' That remains against his character without liis having had a single opportunity of making his defence before any fair tribunal or of meeting his accusers face to face and producing witnesses on his own behalf. I do not suppose my hon. friend the Minister of Agriculture desires to be unjust to this man. I understand that, before he entered the public service Captain Stewart was a Conservative in politics. So far as I know, since he has been in the department he has taken no part in politics. If he has been a Conservative in politics in the past, that is no reason why he should be denied a fair trial or investigation. Why should any man in the public service to whom a salary and a position are an asset as much as property is an asset, be deprived of the position he holds and the salary he enjoys without a trial ? If that can be done why should not any man be deprived of his property or rights without trial in court ? What possible ground can the minister present for treating this officer in the way he has done ?

36181,ca.proc.d.1902-04-16.22.107,1902-04-16,intervention,,,,SUPPLY.,,,"I take no exception to the way in which the leader of the opposition has presented his case. He has presented fairly the facts he has stated, but he has not brought forward the facts which justify the course of the department. 1 may say that this matter lias nothing to do with politics. Captain Stewart's opinions were not in any way the reason for the action taken by the department. Captain Stewart had been for some time in the department as an employee of the Minister of Customs. Years ago, the boat at Halifax was jointly used by the Customs Department and the Department of Agriculture. Some time after the present Minister of Customs and I came into office a change was made. Though it was known to me that Captain Stewart had been a Conservative, I did not take advantage of the change, though it could have been done quite easily, to let him go from the service. This shows that there was no question of politics involved. Whether Captain Stewart has been, since I took office, a Conservative in politics or not, I do not know, and have not sought to ascertain. I certainly did not wish to be harsh in this case-do not like to be harsh in the case of any officer. At the same time, I feel that the discipline of the service must be maintained and, when it comes to a question between an inferior officer and a superior officer, and when the inferior officer has been clearly shown to have been derelict in his duty, it seems to me I must stand by the superior officer and maintain his authority and prestige in the department. Captain Stewart acknowledges that he was absent from duty without leave. He gives excuses, but the statement of his superior officer was very different from the one Captain Stewart



gives. Nevertheless, the fact that he was absent without leave was distinctly acknowledged by him. That was a dereliction of duty. But it was something which might have been overlooked if nothing else had occurred. Here was another matter, however, which was much more serious and which hurt the department much more, and was the fact of his laying up the boat two weeks before he ought to have done so, and worse than that, the misrepresentations, the false statements on his part to his superior officer, as his reasons for doing it. Now it may be said that these facts should have been brought out in an investigation. But as I said, we had first of all the statement of his superior officer, and when it comes to a mere matter of denial or assertion between two officers, I think it is more reasonable to accept that of the superior officer than that of the inferior. I have, however, here a letter written by the people who laid the boat up. who worked on the boat, in which they say distinctly that Captain Stewart's statement^ and representations are not true, and that as a matter of fdct he ought not to have laid up the boat then, that there was no need of doing so. This statement'is signed by Messrs. Ferguson and Cox, the machinists who were repairing the boiler of the boat, and it is written in answer to a letter from Dr. McKay asking them about it. It contains a clear statement from a disinterested party that Captain Stewart's representations as to his reason for laying up the boat, was incorrect and untruthful. Further than that, I find in a letter from Mr. Case, who was the engineer under Captain Stewart, that the latter had stated that he had been informed by Mr. Case that the boiler was ready to be put into the boat on the 15th of July, and he laid up the boat on the 15th of July. He represented that to Dr. McKay, and in his defence read by the hon. gentleman that is his excuse and his statement. But here is the statement of the engineer, and here is the statement of the people who were repairing the boiler, declaring distinctly that Captain Stewart had made a false statement and a false representation. Under these circumstances, and with these proofs, and with Captain Stewart's acknowledgment that he was away .from duty without leave, I felt that in order to maintain the discipline of- the station I had nothing (to do but to accept the complaints of tile superior officer against the subordinate, and to dismiss the subordinate. I do not see how I could have done anything else under the circumstances.
Mr. BORDEN Halifax). If anything could convince one who has examined the papers that there was an absolute necessity for an investigation, it is the answer the hon. gentleman has just made. Dr. McKay states that Captain Stewart made certain statements to him, and then he goes to these men who were to a certain extent under his Hon. Mr. FISHER.
control, Ferguson and Cox, and gets from them a letter stating that these representations, which he alleges Captain Stewart made to him, were untrue and incorrect. Captain Stewart's statement which I have read, and which the minister has apparently forgotten, if he ever read it-Captain Stewart's defence is, not that these representations were true, but that he made no such representations at all to his superior officer, and he points out the reasons why he could not possibly have made such representations. My hon. friend, in the hurry of departmental business, has apparently overlooked this, and he thinks there is some contradiction of Captain Stewart.

Dodwell, the engineer in charge, decided that the boat must be laid up ; and he refers the minister, who apparently has not seen fit to act upon his suggestion-he refers him by implication to Sir. Dodwell, and he refers him by express direction to Mr. Case. But the letters which we have are not a contradiction of Captain Stewart at all, the letters which we have are statements from these men that the alleged representations to Dr. Slc-Ivay are incorrect. Captain Stewart's answer is that he never made any such representations 'to Dr. McKay, that he would have no object in doing so. The hon. gexi-tleman himself has demonstrated clearly the absolute necessity there was that this matter should have been referred to an impartial tribunal for inquiry. Then with respect to this alleged dereliction of duty in going out of town, I want to point out to the hon. gentleman further that no vessel came to Halifax that day, there was no detriment to the public service. Captain Stewart was in reach by telephone all the time, he was only a short distance out on the Margaret Bay Road ; and further than that, Mr. Case, the chief engineer who had charge of the boilers and engines while Captain Stewart was away, and the other men in charge were assigned their duties, and even if a vessel had been reported there could have been no possible detriment to the public service. Now the trivial offence of driving out to Margaret Bay Road in one day out of 1G years, is surely not to lie assigned by the hon. gentleman as a sufficient reason for the discharge of this man after 16 years of faithful service. I see before me my hon. friend from Victoria (Hon. Mr. Ross) who was the chief under whom Captain Stewart served for a considerable portion of Ins time, and I venture to think that my hon. friend from Victoria will corroborate what I have said as to Captain Stewart having been, while under his direction, a faithful, a capable and an efficient officer.

That does not indicate that anybody had ordered Captain Stewart to lay the boat up then, nor was there any need for it when the boiler was not ready. He laid the boat up a fortnight before the boiler was ready, when these other people stated that the boiler was not ready, and 'when Captain Stewart knew it was not ready.

I do not think he will take that position.
Hon. Mr. ROSS (Victoria, N.S.) As the leader of the opposition has appealed to me, I may say, speaking from recollection, that I think Captain Stewart was under me 4:or about ten years. I did not know anything about his politics, whether he had any or not. I found him punctual, steady and attentive. His duties were to go out in his boat upon the harbour and see if there were any arrivals and to report himself to the customs collector in the morning and again in the afternoon. I never had any cause of complaint against him during all the time he was under me, and I am not hware that my successor in the customhouse had any reason to complain of him. 1 think I may say that if he had been continued under my successor in the customhouse, he would likely have been in hiS former position to-day. I may say again that this matter was brought to my notice in Halifax. My course, while in the custom-house when any officer neglected his duty, was to suspend him for a certain time and then restore him so as to give him another trial. My own feeling at the time was that to dismiss Captain Stewart without giving him a chance, after two or three months suspension, was, perhaps, applying to the case a more severe discipline than it merited.

The increase in work is something like 5 or 6 per cent over last year, while the increase in the expenditure amounts to one and one-half per cent. There are applications from officers in all parts of the Dominion for increases, and they receive the best consideration which we are able to give them, but we cannot meet the wishes of all by any manner of means. It is intended at the beginning of the fiscal year to do something for such officers as we consider are underpaid, if the House gives us this amount of money. We also find that during the year expenses come upon us which cannot be foreseen, in the growing business of the country, and I have to ask the House to have some confidence in me, and to allow me the amount I ask, which will not be expended unless it is absolutely required. 1 think the hon. gentleman will agree that while the expenditure is increasing the work is increasing much more. I do not simply mean that we are taking in extra revenue, but that owing to the immense increase of traffic receipts, the number of entries has greatly increased the amount of clerical work that has to be performed and the outside services that have to be rendered in the transit of goods. For instance, I have now a requisition from my inspector who says that it is necessary to have two extra men at Fort Erie, in order that the increasing transfer work may be properly attended to. Of course, there is no revenue derived from that. Along the boundary in the eastern townships we have the same thing to look after. At Depot Harbour, where a couple of years ago we had none, it is necessary for us to have one officer all the time, and perhaps this year we may have to have two. I merely cite these as illustrations of the work that cannot be foreseen ; and I have to ask the House to have some confidence in me, because in reality I have to provide for a year and a half ahead. We cannot tell what demand will be made upon us. I can only assure hon. gentlemen that there is no extravagance so far as I know. In fact many of the officers to whom we have found ourselves unable to give any increase, have made out a pretty strong case, and we have to try to meet these cases and do justice as far as we can.

Very strong pressure has been brought on the hon. gentleman's department to make it a port of entry. I admit that the business done there in the past would perhaps not have warranted his doing so, but a large beet sugar industry is well under way there, it is now doing a considerable export and import business, and the people are without those facilities to which a place of the importance which Dresden has suddenly developed is entitled to. The people there should not be obliged to go to Wallace-burg, twelve miles away on the one hand or to Chatham twelve miles away on the other, and I cannot conceive of any more pressing case than this one. More than half a million dollars are being expended there now, large quantities of goods are being shipped from other ports and are being brought in, and to make it a port of entry would not entail an expenditure, of more than $400 to $500. Or it might be made an outport of the town of Wallaceburg, if nothing better could be done. If the hon. minister knew all the circumstances and was aware of all the possibilities with regard to the business of the place, he would grant my request. If no portion of this vote is to go for that purpose, I would ask my hon. friend to make provision for it in the supplementaries, which no doubt he will bring down.

I endeavour to accommodate the people as much as possible. By what my hon. friend as told .me, Dresden is likely to become a much more important point than it has been, and while we may not be able to see our way clear to give it the facilities of a port at present, perhaps before I have the opportunity of asking a grant another year, it may become apparent that it should be
made an outport. This vote covers the whole Dominion except the Yukon, and I could not possibly meet all the requisitions made out of this vote, but the matter is engaging the attention of the department, and if we have not a report already from the inspector, he will be asked to furnish it.

Mr. CLANCY'. I think the hon. gentleman (Mr. Paterson) is under a misapprehension. In the early history of the Wallaceburgh factory there was some negotiation looking to an arrangement of that kind. The Benton Harbour sugar factory, it seems, had been built in a locality that turned out unsuitable for the growth of the sugar beet. They did not come to an arrangement with regard to Wallaceburgh, but Berlin, I believe, has been chosen as the place to which the Benton Harbour factory is to be removed. The buildings at Dresden and Wallaceburgh are new, and so are the plants. Taking the two places together, the probability is that about a million and a quarter will be spent. So, the hon. gentleman will see, that it is very important that facilities should be afforded.

the work might be extened. There is one item that comes under the attention of the Minister of Inland Revenue. But, so far as the goods are imported, it seems to me that the analysis and test might be made at the border. I refer to fertilizers. Under the Act, only fertilizers having a certain quantity of nitrogen or phosphorous or both can be sold in Canada. These articles are manufactured in Canada, and when so manufactured come under the test of the Inland Revenue Department. And so do the others, for that matter. I notice that in the last bulletin, No. 75, issued by the Inland Revenue Department, there are a large number of cases where the requirements of the Act are not complied with, and, almost invariably they are fertilizers that have been imported. This ia a matter to which I intended to call the attention of the Minister of Inland Revenue, but the importation of fertilizers affects the Customs Department. The Act says :
No fertilizer shall he sold or offered or exposed for sale unless it contains at least eight per cent of available phosphoric acid, or four per cent of ammonia or its equivalent in nit-' 1'ogen or nitric acid : or, when both phosphoric acid and ammonia are present, at least live per cent of available phosphoric acid and two per cent of ammonia or its equivalent in nitrogen or nitric acid.
I find that almost the bulk of the fertilizers imported have under the percentage that is called for and which is required from the manufacturers in Canada. I know at the present time it does not a/ppear to come under the department of the Minister of Customs; but I think it would be a wise thing if these fertilizers as they are imported could be analyzed in the customs laboratory, for once they get into this country it is hard to follow them up.

Minister of Customs to the matter of the inspection of coal oil at Port Arthur. During the discussion with the hon. Minister of Inland Revenue (Mr. Bernier), while his estimates were being voted, the matter of the abominable coal oil that passed the customs officer and which went broadcast over the country thereby becoming a scandal, the question was asked as to who was responsible for it and the hon. Minister of Inland Revenue, whom we believed at that time to be responsible, said that it was the collector of customs at that port who was responsible. I would like the hon. Minister of Customs to be able to say to the House if he has had any complaints against that inspection, or what explanation his officer has made when he takes his estimates up again. 1 assume' that it cannot have been unknown to the government, or to the minister who has charge of the officer at Port Arthur.,that he permitted this enormous quantity of inferior coal oil to cover the whole country from Edmonton to the Red River as was shown by every hon. member from the North-west Territories during the time the question was under discussion with the hon. Minister of Inland Revenue.

I said to him that I did not think my estimates would be reached before he came back. He has gone and now that the hon. leader of the opposition (Mr. Borden, Halifax) has asked me to let my estimates remain and as the hon. member for Macdonald (Mr. Boyd) has mentioned a question that he desires information on before we go on, perhaps I had better alow my estimates to stand till the hon. member for East Lambton comes back, lest he might think it was a breach of faith on my part, although I told him that I could not tell whether the question would come up or not, and so, my estimates, if there are others ready to be gone on with, may be allowed to stand until next week.

I have taken the pains to send for the civil list and I find that James Currie was born on the 7th January, 1835, which would make him 67 years of age. He was appointed to his position on the 19th May, 1880, so that he was 22 years in the service. Of course, he was capable of being superannuated. I find also that Mr. William Albert Lochart was appointed collector of customs at the port of St. John, a very important port, on the 7th May, 1900, and that he was born on the 11th March. 1835, being just the same age as Mr. Currie when he was appointed to that position. Mr. Currie has been superannuated because of old age and Mr. Lockhart who is of the same age was appointed two years ago as collector of customs at the port of St. John. I consider that scarcely fair. Mr. Currie belongs to that race of men who, at 60 or 70 years of age, are active and vigorous as may be instanced by our good friend from Victoria, N.S. (Mr. Ross) who is 80 years of age and who is active and vigorous still. I say it is entirely wrong for this man to be superannuated at the age of 67 when you appointed a man two years ago at the port of St. John of the same age. and especially when you superannuated Mr. Currie, not because of old age, but because you desired to find a place for an importunate partisan.
Some resolutions reported.
On motion of the Prime Minister, House adjourned at 11.55 p.m.
